<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Transaction Analysis workspace shows a comprehensive
view of transactions, which enables you to identify problem transactions
across CICS® regions and z/OS® images for the CICSplex. </p>

<div class="section"><p>This workspace displays data provided by the <a href="attr_tran.html#attr_tran">CICSplex Transaction Analysis attribute group</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>The predefined Transaction Analysis workspace contains
the following views:</p>
</div>

<div class="section"> <ul>
<li>The Transaction Processor Utilization bar chart shows the amount
of CPU time being used by each task.</li>

<li>The Transaction Analysis table view provides a system-wide view
of executing transactions. <p> You can add the <strong>System Task</strong> filtering
column to the table view to identify CICS system tasks and non CICS
system tasks. You modify the query for the Transaction Analysis workspace
to include the appropriate setting (Yes or No) for the <strong>System Task</strong> column.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>The Transaction Analysis table view provides links to

The EXEC interface block (EIB) summary table accesses all the fields in the EIB by name. The EIB contains information that is useful during the execution of an application program, such as the transaction identifier, the time and date (initially when the task is started, and subsequently, if updated by the application program using ASKTIME), and the cursor position on a display device. The EIB also contains information that is helpful when a dump is used to debug a program.">Transaction Details workspace</a>, showing: <ul>

<div class="section"><p>It also provides links to the Transaction Details in 3270
and Online Data Viewing in 3270 views of the OMEGAMON 3270 interface.
When you right-click a link icon in the Transaction Analysis table
view and select Transaction Details in 3270 or Online Data Viewing
in 3270, you must enter your terminal session user credentials in
the dialog and click <strong>OK</strong>. A terminal view is displayed within
the workspace, with the appropriate details. Using this panel, you
can examine much more historical data than is available in the <span class="keyword">Tivoli Enterprise Portal</span> workspace.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>Note that each of these predefined workspace links to
a 3270 session has an associated sample script. You should review
these scripts prior to using them in your environment.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>You can link to the Detailed Thread Exception workspace
provided by the <span class="keyword">OMEGAMON for DB2 on z/OS</span> product
for the selected DB2® Correlation
identifier, which allows you to track a transaction and the activity
as it moves between the CICS and DB2 products.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>Likewise, you can link to its Single DB2 Thread Summary workspace, of the <span class="keyword">OMEGAMON for DB2 on z/OS</span> product
filtered by the DB2 Correlation

running transaction.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>If the <span class="keyword">OMEGAMON for IMS on z/OS</span> product
is also installed and running, you can link to its DBCTL Detailed
Thread Activity (Active) workspace, filtered by the CICS Jobname and CICS Task
