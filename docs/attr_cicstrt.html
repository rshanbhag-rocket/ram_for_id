<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicstrt__CICSTRT"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Transaction Timings attributes
report where the time was spent during the life of this transaction,
based on data collected by the CICS Monitoring Facility.</span> Use
the CICSplex Transaction Timings attributes to find which timing is
a large percent of the transaction response time, then determine which
conditions might cause the timing to be excessive.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstrt__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstrt__CPUTIME"><strong>CPU Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the amount of CPU time (accurate to two decimal, places) used by the
transaction.</span> The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DD format,
for example, 00:20:00.56 or as SSSSSSS.DD, for example, 1200.56. 
If you are using variable substitution, the value in this example
would display as 120056.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstrt__DISPTIME"><strong>Dispatch Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the amount of time (in thousandths of a second) that this transaction
spent dispatched on a CICS TCB.</span> It includes QR TCB Elapsed Time
and Other TCBs Elapsed Time attributes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstrt__ELAPTIME"><strong>Elapsed Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates

 If you are using variable substitution, the value in this example
would display as 1200567. See the online help for more details on
variable substitution or inputting values in situations and filters.</p>

the combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>
