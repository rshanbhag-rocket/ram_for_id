<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicstca__CICSTCA"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex
Task Class Analysis attributes provide details about the transaction
classes defined to CICS.</span> They enable you to see how close your
CICS systems are to the limits set for the number of tasks in a given
class. Use the Task Class Analysis attributes in situations to monitor
activity for a specific transaction class. If the percentage for a
class consistently runs at 100%, it indicates that tasks defined in
a class are not initiated because the maximum number of tasks in a
class has been reached. If CICS is under utilizing the processor resources,
you might want to consider an increase in the class limits to allow
more work to flow through the system.</p>

<p>These attributes provide data for the Task Class Analysis table
view.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The attributes within the CICSplex Task Class Analysis group are stored for historical
retrieval within the Tivoli Data Warehouse. Selected attributes within this group are candidates for
the Tivoli Data Warehouse summarization and pruning features. There might be an attribute group that
is displayed in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Query Editor and Situation Editor under the name,
CICSplex Service Class Raw; however, it cannot be used to create user-defined queries or situations
and should be ignored.</div>

<p id="attr_cicstca__TOTAT"><strong>Attach Requests</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The total number of tasks that had executed and are currently
executing in this class.</span> The value format is a positive integer.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__AVGWT"><strong>Average Queuing Time</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the average time spent waiting by those tasks that were
queued. This metric does not include the wait time for tasks that are currently queuing.</span> The
value format is a number of seconds, to three decimal places.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the job name or modify ID of the
CICS region being monitored.</span> Each CICS region in a z/OS operating
system has a unique name. This name is an alphanumeric string, with
a maximum of eight characters, and case sensitive. CICS region names
are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__CLIMIT"><strong>Class Limit</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the maximum number of tasks allowed
to run in the transaction class.</span> The value format is a positive
integer, maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__CNAME"><strong>Class Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the transaction class name.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum eight characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__CTASKS"><strong> Current Tasks</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the current task count in the transaction
class.</span> The value format is a positive integer, maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__NQUEUE"><strong>Number Queued</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the number of transactions that are
queued.</span> The value format is a positive integer, maximum four
bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__OTWDU"><strong>Oldest Task Queuing Duration</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the average time spent waiting by the oldest task that is
currently queued.</span> The value format is a number of seconds, to three decimal places.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID)
and CICS region name.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string,
maximum 32 bytes, and case sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
system changes the status of the item accordingly. If the names of
the origin node and the managed systems do not match, the status of
the item remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__PTASKS"><strong>Peak Tasks</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the highest number of active and
queued transactions.</span> The value format is a positive integer,
maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__PLIMIT"><strong>Percent of Limit</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the number of active tasks in a class
divided by the class limit.</span> The value format is a percentage
in the range 0-100.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__PQLIM"><strong>Percent of Queue Limit</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the number of queued tasks in a class
divided by the queue limit.</span> The value format is a percentage
in the range 0-100.</p>

are queued.</span> The value format is a positive integer, maximum four
bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the four-character name that uniquely
identifies an active z/OS operating system.</span> The value format
is an alphanumeric string, maximum four characters, and case sensitive.
z/OS System IDs are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__PURQU"><strong>Tasks Purged while Queuing</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the number of tasks which were purged while queuing.</span>
The value format is a positive integer.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstca__XLIMIT"><strong>Times at Limit</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the number of times the transaction
class limit has been reached.</span> The value format is a positive
integer, maximum four bytes.</p>
