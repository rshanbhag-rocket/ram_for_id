<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The UOW Analysis workspace shows the data about the forced
decisions, the shunted UOWs that currently exist in the CICS® region, and the accumulated time that all
shunted UOWs have been shunted. It also displays data on the number
of forced heuristic decisions and the number of minutes that all shunted
UOWs have been shunted.</p>

<div class="section"><p>A forced decision can occur after an indoubt UOW remains
unresolved for a user-defined time period. CICS unconditionally backs out or commits the
changes made by the UOW in order to release the resources held by
the indoubt UOW. </p>
<p>The predefined UOW Analysis workspace contains
these views:</p>
</div>

<div class="section"> <ul>
<li>The UOW Analysis table view </li>

<li>The Unit-of-Work Disposition bar chart </li>

<li>The Minutes Shunted graph </li>

</ul>
<p>The Unit-of-Work Disposition bar chart also indicates the
number of shunted UOWs that currently exist in the CICS region.</p>
