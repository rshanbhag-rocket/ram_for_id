   <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The User Group List attributes show information on the CP/SM
    groups being used as User Groups in <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON AI for CICS</span>.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__AIDS"><strong>AIDs</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the number of automatic initiate descriptors (AIDs) found on the AID
chain within a given CICS region.</span> The value format is a positive
integer, maximum four characters. An AID is created when CICS is unable
to start a task because a resource is not available. An accumulation
of these descriptors can adversely affect CICS storage and CPU availability.
An AID remains in CICS until the resource is available, CICS is shut
down, or the AID is stopped.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__WSTIMOUT"><strong>Any Current WS Faults</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates if any current Web Service requests
had a timeout associated with them.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__WSFAULT"><strong>Any Current WS Timeouts</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates if any current Web Service requests
had a fault associated with them.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__ASID"><strong>ASID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The unique
address space identifier of the address space on the LPAR; it is displayed
as a four digit hexadecimal field.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or the modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__SYSIDNT"><strong>CICS SYSIDNT</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the four character CICS system ID assigned to this CICS region.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum four characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS system IDs are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__CICSTODB"><strong>CICS TOD Clock</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the time of day clock setting in the CICS Common System Area (CSA).</span> The
time value is measured to two decimal places. The value can be entered
in the HH:MM:SS.DD format, for example, 00:20:00.56 or as SSSSSSS.DD,
for example, 1200.56.  If you are using variable substitution, the
value in this example would display as 120056.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__TODUPDT"><strong>CICS TOD Updated</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
whether the CICS time of day clock is being updated.</span> When a task
goes into a loop and the CICS task dispatcher is unable to regain
control, the CICS time of day clock field in the Common System Area
is not updated by task control. These are the values: Yes and No</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__VERSION"><strong>CICS Version</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the version of CICS running in the region.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__CICSPLEX"><strong>CICSPlex Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the name of the CICSPlex that
this CICS region is assigned to.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__CPUUTIL"><strong>CPU Utilization</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the percentage of accumulated CPU time for the CICS region.</span> This
value is calculated at the beginning and end of a short elapsed-time
interval. The difference between these two values is the amount of
CPU consumed in the CICS region during that interval; this difference
is then represented as a percentage of the elapsed-time interval.
The value format is a percentage in the range 0-999.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accumulated CPU time at start of time interval = 2 sec</li>

<li>Length of time interval = 10 sec</li>

<li>Accumulated CPU time at end of time interval = 5 sec</li>

<li>CPU consumed during the 10-second time interval = 5 - 2 sec =
3 sec</li>

</ul>

<p>Therefore percent of CPU used during time interval = 3/10 =<strong>30</strong>%.</p>

<p>A low-to-zero value indicates the absence of a workload or non
dispatch by z/OS. A high-to-100% (or greater) value indicates a heavy
workload or a potential loop in either your application or CICS code.
If the workload is running on multiple CPUs, the CPU utilization can
exceed 100%.</p>

<p>If you want fractional values, you must include a decimal point
and either zero or one decimal places; for example, <strong>5.2</strong>.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__CBUFFW"><strong>Current VSAM Buffer Waits</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the total number of current
VSAM buffer waits for the file definitions in the current CICS region.</span> The
value format is a positive integer, maximum four characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__CSTRINGW"><strong>Current VSAM String Waits</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the total number of current
VSAM string waits for the file definitions in the current CICS region.</span> The
value format is a positive integer, maximum four characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__ENQWAIT"><strong>Enqueue Waits</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the number of CICS enqueues exclusively controlling a resource that
tasks are also waiting for.</span> The value format is a positive integer,
maximum four characters. A large number signifies that too many tasks
are competing for exclusive access to the same resources at the same
time, which indicates a looping task, a deadlock situation, or poor
response time from a task that holds an enqueued resource.</p>

<p>This value is stored in units of 1/100; therefore, when you open
an event as attributes, you must interpret the performance index value
of 1234 as 12.34. When you see the performance index in a view, however,
a decimal point is inserted; therefore you interpret a value of 1234
as 12.34.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__GRPMSL"><strong>Group MSL</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the drop down box list for display.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__ICES"><strong>ICEs</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the number of interval control elements (ICEs) found on the ICE chain
within a given CICS region.</span> The value format is a positive integer,
maximum four characters. An ICE is created whenever a time-dependent
request for a CICS service is made. When the expiration time for the
ICE is reached, the CICS service requested is initiated if the resources
required for the service are available. If the requested service is
task initiation, CICS creates an automatic initiate descriptor (AID)
on ICE expiration. The AID either initiates the task or waits until
required resources become available.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__IORATE"><strong>I/O Rate</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the rate at which I/O operations are being performed in a specified
CICS region per second of elapsed time.</span> It includes both application-
and CICS-initiated I/O operations. The value format is a maximum of
four characters.  If you want fractional values, you must include
decimal points and up to two decimal places. For example, if you want
5.2 seconds, add the decimal point.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__MAXLSQA"><strong>Largest Contiguous Available LSQA</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the largest amount of contiguous
local system queue area (LSQA) that is available.</span> If LSQA accumulates
to reach the highest level of the allocated private region, address
space termination occurs. The value format is a positive integer,
maximum four characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__MAXOSCOR"><strong>Largest Contiguous Available OSCOR</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the largest amount of contiguous
free operating system core (OSCOR) that is available.</span> If OSCOR
is consumed to meet the IEALIMIT or expands to the lowest level of
the local system queue area (LSQA) address space termination occurs.
The value format is a positive integer, maximum four characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__PCNTMXT"><strong>Maximum Tasks Percent</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the total number of tasks within
a CICS region, expressed as a percentage of the MXT limit.</span> Attaching
of new tasks within the CICS region stops when the maximum task limit
reaches 100%. The value format is a percentage in the range 0-100.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__DORDER"><strong>Order</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the order of the entry.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__PAGERATE"><strong>Page Rate</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the number of page-in operations in the CICS region per CPU second.</span> The
paging rate is important because CICS transactions wait until a page-in
resolves. The value format is a maximum of four characters.  If you
want fractional values, you must include decimal points and up to
two decimal places. For example, if you want 5.2 seconds, add the
decimal point.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__REMQUEUE"><strong>Queued Remote Requests</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICS region's total number of queued
allocation requests for MRO, ISC, and IP sessions. </span>The value
format is a positive integer of maximum four bytes</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrov__STATUS"><strong>Region Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates

<dt class="dlterm">Inactive</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">CICS has registered with an SMSVSAM server, but VSAM RLS is currently
inactive due to an SMSVSAM server failure. All RLS requests will fail
until CICS performs dynamic VSAM RLS restart, which occurs automatically
when the SMSVSAM server is restarted.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">RLS NO</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">This CICS region does not support VSAM RLS, either because CICS
was initialized with RLS=NO as a system initialization parameter or
