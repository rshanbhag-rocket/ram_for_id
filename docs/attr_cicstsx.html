temporary main storage.</span></p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The attributes within the CICSplex Temporary Storage Extended
group are stored for historical retrieval within the Tivoli Data Warehouse.
Selected attributes within this group are candidates for the Tivoli
Data Warehouse summarization and pruning features.</div>

temporary storage.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicstsx__TSGNAG"><strong>Aux Storage GETs</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the number of records that application programs obtained from auxiliary
temporary storage.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicstsx__TSGNBCA"><strong>Buffer count</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the number of temporary storage buffers specified in the TS system
initialization parameter or in the overrides.</span> The number of buffers
allocated might exceed the number requested.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsx__TSGTRDN"><strong>Buffer reads</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the number of times a CI has to be read from disk.</span> Increasing
the buffer allocation decreases this activity.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsx__TSGTWTN"><strong>Buffer writes</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the total number of WRITEs to the temporary storage data set.</span> This
includes both WRITEs necessitated by recovery requirements (see next
item) and WRITEs forced by the buffer being needed to accommodate
another CI.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsx__TSGNAVB"><strong>Bytes per CI</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The

data set.</span> The size of VSAM's unit of transmission between disk

queued because no strings were available.</span> This is zero if the
number of strings is the same as the number of buffers. If this is
a high percentage (over 30%) of the number of I/O requests, consider
increasing the number of strings initially allocated.</p>

or (using a HANDLE CONDITION NOSPACE command) might have been forced
to terminate.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsx__TSGTWTNF"><strong>Format writes</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the number of times a new control interval (CI) was successfully written

in the temporary storage data set.</span> A formatted write is attempted
only if the current number of control intervals (CIs) available in
the auxiliary data set have all been used.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsx__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>
