<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_rls__RLS"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
CICSplex RLS Lock Analysis attributes report on tasks waiting for
a Record Level Sharing (RLS) resource and tasks holding the records.</span> Use
the CICSplex RLS Lock Analysis attributes in situations to help identify
applications that are making poor use of serially reusable resources
and degrading system performance.</p>

<p>These attributes provide data for the VSAM RLS Lock Analysis table
view.</p>

<p id="attr_rls__KEY"><strong>Argument or Key</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
one of following identifiers: the complete record key for the VSAM
KSDS files, the relative byte address for the VSAM RRDS files, or
the record number for the VSAM ESDS files.</span> The value format is
an alphanumeric string, a maximum of 256 characters, and is case-sensitive.</p>

<p id="attr_rls__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Jobname</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates either the job name or modify
ID of the CICS region being monitored or the job name of the CICS
region running a transaction that is holding an RLS record being waited
on by transactions running in the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique job name. This
job name is used for operations initiated from the z/OS system console.
The value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum eight characters,
and is case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_rls__DSN"><strong>Dataset Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the name of the VSAM data set allocated to the selected CICS region.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, a maximum of 44 characters,
and is case-sensitive.</p>

<p id="attr_rls__FILETYPE"><strong>Dataset Type</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the name of the type of VSAM data set.</span> These are the valid values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">ESDS</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Entry sequence data set</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">KSDS</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Key sequence data set</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">RRDS</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Relative record data set</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">VRRDS</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">VSAM relative record data set</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Unknown</dt>

<dd class="dlentry"></dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_rls__KEYLEN"><strong>Key Length</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the length of the record key.</span> The value format is an integer,
maximum two bytes, and in the range 0-32767.</p>

<p id="attr_rls__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the combination of the z/OS System ID (SMFID) and the CICS region
name.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32
bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p id="attr_rls__SYSTEMID"><strong> z/OS System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the four character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> z/OS System IDs are always in
uppercase characters. The value is an alphanumeric string, a maximum
of four characters and case-sensitive.</p>

<p id="attr_rls__TASKNO"><strong>Task No.</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the number sequentially assigned by CICS to uniquely identify each
task.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string, a maximum of
five characters, and is case-sensitive.</p>

<p id="attr_rls__TASKSTAT"><strong>Task State</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
whether the task is waiting for a record or holding one.</span> These
are the values: Holder, Retained, and Waiter.</p>

<p id="attr_rls__SUSPTIME"><strong>Time in Suspend</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the length of time the task has been in a waiting or holding state.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 11 characters. In
the example, format is hh:mm:ss:hh Indicates the amount of time is
zero hours, 14 minutes, 7 seconds, and 42 hundredths of a second.
Example: 00:14:07.42.</p>

<p id="attr_rls__SUSPHH"><strong>Time in Suspend Hours</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the hours portion of the length
of time the task has been in a waiting or holding state.</span> The
value format is a numeric string with a maximum of two characters.</p>

<p id="attr_rls__SUSPMM"><strong>Time in Suspend Minutes</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the minutes portion of the length
of time the task has been in a waiting or holding state.</span> These
are the values: 0-59.</p>

<p id="attr_rls__TIMESUSP"><strong>Time in Suspend Numeric</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the length of time (accurate
to two decimal places) the task has been in a waiting state or a holding
state.</span> This attribute allows the time to be presented graphically.
The value can be entered in the hh:mm:ss.dd format, for example, 00:20:00.56
or as sssssss.dd, for example, 1200.56.  If you are using variable
substitution, the value in this example would display as 120056.</p>
