<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsbnd__CICSBND"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Application Bundle Detail
attribute group provides details about a CICS application bundle that
is used for deployment of the application into CICS.</span> You can
create resources for your applications by defining each resource individually
in a CICS region. Alternatively, you can deploy an application as
a bundle and use this resource to create some of these resources dynamically
for you. The bundle resource represents the application, so you can
also manage its availability in CICS by enabling and disabling the
bundle resource. </p>

<p id="attr_cicsbnd__BASESCOPE"><strong>Base Scope</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
universal resource identifier (URI) that defines the root namespace
where the contents of the bundle are created.</span> This identifier
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of 255 characters. A scope
value is used when you want to logically group different bundles together. </p>

<p id="attr_cicsbnd__BUNDLEDIR"><strong>Bundle Directory</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
name of the root directory for the resource bundle.</span> This fully
qualified name is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of 255 characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsbnd__BUNDLE"><strong>Bundle Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
name of the application bundle that is used for deployment of the
application into CICS.</span> This name is an alphanumeric string, with
a maximum of eight characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsbnd__STATUS"><strong>Bundle Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
current status of the resource bundle used for deployment.</span> These
are the valid values:  </p>

<ul>
<li>ENABLED 1</li>

<li>DISABLED 2</li>

<li>ENABLING 3</li>

<li>DISABLING 4</li>

<li>DISCARDING 5</li>

</ul>

<p id="attr_cicsbnd__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. The CICS region names are always uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsbnd__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsbnd__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
four-character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum four characters, and case-sensitive. The z/OS System
IDs are always uppercase characters.</p>
