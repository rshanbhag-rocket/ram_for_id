<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicstr3__CICSTR3"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Transaction Wait Other Analysis
attributes report a breakdown of the total amount of time the transaction
waited as a result of other wait types.</span> Use the CICSplex Transaction
Wait Other Analysis attributes to find which timing is a large percent
of the transaction response time, then determine which conditions
might cause the timing to be excessive.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstr3__FDELAY"><strong>First Dispatch Delay</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the amount of time, (accurate
to three decimal places) that the transaction waited prior to first
dispatch.</span> The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format,
for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example, 1200.567.
 If you are using variable substitution, the value in this example
would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstr3__MAXOTCB"><strong>CICS MAXOPENTCBS Delay</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the amount of time, (accurate
to three decimal places) that the transaction waited to obtain a CICS

MAXOPENTCBS.</span> The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format,
for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example, 1200.567.
 If you are using variable substitution, the value in this example
would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstr3__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each

is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstr3__DISPWAIT"><strong>Dispatchable Wait Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the amount of time, (accurate
to three decimal places)  that the transaction waited as a result
of giving up control to another task.</span> The value can be entered
in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format, for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD,
for example 1200.567.  If you are using variable substitution, the
value in this example would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstr3__EXTERNAL"><strong>External Wait Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the amount of time, (accurate
to three decimal places) that the transaction waited for one or more
ECBs as a result of using the EXEC CICS WAIT EXTERNAL ECBLIST command.</span> The
value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format, for example, 00:20:00.567
or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example 1200.567.  If you are using variable
substitution, the value in this example would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstr3__GENQ"><strong>Global ENQ Delay</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the amount of time, (accurate to three decimal places) that the transaction
waited for a CICS Task Control global ENQ.</span> The value can be entered
in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format, for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD,
for example 1200.567.  If you are using variable substitution, the
value in this example would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstr3__ICWAIT"><strong>Interval Control Delay</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the amount of time, (accurate
to three decimal places) that the transaction waited as a result of
using the EXEC CICS DELAY command (for a time interval or a specific
time of day) or the EXEC CICS RETRIEVE command with the WAIT option.</span> The
value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format, for example, 00:20:00.567
or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example 1200.567.  If you are using variable
substitution, the value in this example would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstr3__JVMSUSP"><strong>JVM Suspend Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the amount of time, (accurate to three decimal places) that the transaction
was suspended by the CICS dispatcher while running in the CICS Java
Virtual Machine.</span> The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD
 format, for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example,
1200.567.  If you are using variable substitution, the value in this
example would display as 1200567. </p>

<p id="attr_cicstr3__LENQ"><strong>Local ENQ Delay</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the amount of time, (accurate to three decimal places) that the transaction
waited for a CICS Task Control ENQ.</span> The value can be entered
in the HH:MM:SS.DDD  format, for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD,
for example, 1200.567.  If you are using variable substitution, the
value in this example would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstr3__LOCKMAN"><strong>Lock Manager Delay</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates

name.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32
bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>
