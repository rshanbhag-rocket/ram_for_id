<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> provides workspaces for viewing information about each CICS® region you are monitoring. The table views, graphs, and charts within each workspace report attribute information about each CICS region you are monitoring. </p>

<div class="section"><p>You can use the table views, graphs, and charts within each workspace to perform the following tasks:</p>
</div>

<div class="section"> <ul>
<li>Investigate attribute information relating to a change in state</li>

<li>Monitor the performance of each CICS region, helping you to identify system bottlenecks and evaluate tuning decisions</li>

<li>Select the most effective threshold values for situations you create</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>The workspaces deliver detailed, current data that enable you to analyze CICS regions, connections, service class performance, transactions, tasks waiting on RLS resources, and temporary storage queues. For an overview of available workspaces, see <a href="rpt_organization.html#rpt_organization" title="IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS provides predefined workspaces that are displayed in the Navigator Physical view of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal.">Organization of the predefined workspaces</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>In addition to table views and graphs, a workspace contains other views, for example, a 3270 terminal session, a text view, a browser session, an event console, or a Take Action pane that gives you the ability to send commands to the operator console. Certain workspace views provide links to subsidiary (secondary) workspaces, and dynamic, runtime links to other OMEGAMON® monitoring products, for example, <span class="keyword">OMEGAMON on z/OS</span> and <span class="keyword">OMEGAMON for Mainframe Networks</span>.</p>
