report extended CICS dispatcher TCB pool information in an active
system managed by CICSPlex SM.</span></p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The attributes within the CICSplex Dispatcher TCB Pools group
are stored for historical retrieval within the Tivoli Data Warehouse.
Selected attributes within this group are candidates for the Tivoli
Data Warehouse summarization and pruning features.</div>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight  characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CDPCURNW"><strong> Current tasks waiting</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the current number of tasks waiting
for this TCB.</span></p>

in the CICS dispatcher TCB modes that reside in this TCB pool.</span></p>

in this TCB pool and being used.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CDPCMMWS"><strong>Current TCB Mismatch Waits</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the current number of TCB mismatch
waits by TCB requests using this pool.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CDPCMMWT"><strong>Current TCB Mismatch Wait Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the current wait time (accurate to
three decimal places) for the current TCB mismatch waits by TCB requests
using this pool.</span> The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD
format, for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example 1200.567.
 If you are using variable substitution, the value in this example
would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CDPCURWT"><strong>Current Waiting Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the current delay time, accurate to
three decimal places, for the TCB requests that are currently delayed
because the system has reached the limit for the number of TCBs allowed
in this pool.</span> The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format,
for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example 1200.567.
 If you are using variable substitution, the value in this example
would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CDPMXTCB"><strong>Maximum TCBs</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the value for the maximum number of TCBs allowed in this pool.</span> The
value is specified in the system initialization parameter MAXOPENTCBS
(for the open TCBs pool) or MAXJVMTCBS (for the JVM TCBs pool).</p>

<p> It can be changed by an override, or changed dynamically using <code class="ph codeph">CEMT
SET SYSTEM MAX<span class="ph synph"><span class="ph var">xxxx</span></span>TCBS(value)</code> or <code class="ph codeph">EXEC
CICS SET SYSTEM MAX<span class="ph synph"><span class="ph var">xxxx</span></span>TCBS</code> (fullword
binary data-value) commands.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CDPPEANW"><strong>Peak Tasks Waiting</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the peak number of TCB requests that
were delayed because the system had reached the limit for the number
of TCBs allowed in this pool.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CDPPNUAT"><strong>Peak TCBs Attached</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the peak number of TCBs attached in
the CICS dispatcher TCB mode that reside in this TCB pool.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CDPPNUUS"><strong>Peak TCB in Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the peak number of CICS TCBs used that were attached in this TCB pool.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CDPPMMWS"><strong>Peak TCB Mismatch Waits</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the peak number of TCB mismatch waits
by TCB requests using this pool.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the four-character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum four characters, and case-sensitive. z/OS System IDs
are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CDPMMWTS"><strong>TCB Mismatch Waits</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total number of TCB mismatch waits,
that is, TCB requests that waited because there was no TCB available
matching the request, but there was at least one nonmatching free
TCB.</span> For J8 and J9 mode TCBs in the JVM pool, this shows the
requests that waited for a TCB of the correct mode (J8 or J9) and
JVM profile.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CDPMMWTM"><strong>TCB Mismatch Wait Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total time (accurate to three decimal

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CDPTOTMW"><strong>TCB Requests Delayed for z/OS Storage</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total number of z/OS storage requests
that have waited because no TCB was available, and none might be created
because of z/OS storage constraints.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscdp__CDPTOTMT"><strong>Time waiting for MVS storage</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total time (accurate to three decimal
places) spent in z/OS storage waits by TCB requests using this pool.</span> The
value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format, for example, 00:20:00.567
or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example 1200.567.  If you are using variable
