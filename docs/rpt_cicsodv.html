<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Online Data Viewing workspace displays the information
collected from the historical data analysis that has been set for
each CICS® region.</p>

<div class="section"><p>The predefined Online Data Viewing workspace contains
the following views:</p>
</div>

<div class="section"> <ul>
<li>Historical Transaction Processor Utilization bar chart. This compares
the amount of CPU (in seconds) used by each task.</li>

<li>Historical Transaction Overview table. This shows the start and
end time that was set for the collection of historical data.  <p> For
each task, it shows the transaction, terminal ID, transaction type,
user ID, program ID, CPU time, response time, storage high water mark
(HWM), file requests, terminal I/O, and abend code for that task.
It also shows the operation and Web service name for transaction tracking.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>Using the query editor, you can filter the data that has
been collected and stored by historical data collection.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>The transaction tracking enhancement provides you with
the ability to monitor all the components that consist of a CICS application. OMEGAMON® for CICS on z/OS® interfaces
with IBM® Tivoli® Composite Application Manager (ITCAM)
for CICS v7.1.0 and ITCAM for
Transactions v7.1.0 to correlate these transactions. </p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>ITCAM for CICS v7.1.0
is used to track Dynamic Program Link (DPL) requests to or from a CICS program; it can track requests
through CICS Transaction Gateway.
ITCAM for CICS v7.1.0 provides
a correlation for Service-oriented architecture (SOA) and WebSphere® MQ traffic into CICS. ITCAM for CICS also provides the capability to track CICS transaction routing and function
shipping requests.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>This workspace has a link to the <a href="rpt_cicsapptrace.html#rpt_cicsapptrace" title="The Application Trace workspace displays the application trace data for a specific transaction.">Application Trace workspace</a>, if trace details
exist for a specific transaction.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>It also provides a link to the Online Data Viewing panel
of the OMEGAMON for CICS (3270) interface. When you right-click a
link icon in the Historical Transaction Overview table view and select
Online Data Viewing in 3270, you must enter your terminal session
user credentials in the dialog and click <strong>OK</strong>. A terminal view
is displayed within the workspace, with the appropriate details.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>Note that this predefined workspace link to a 3270 session
has an associated sample script. You should review the script prior
to using it in your environment.</p>
