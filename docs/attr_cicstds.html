<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicstds__CICSTDS"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex
Transient Data Summary attribute group provides statistics on the
current use of intrapartition resources.</span> Use the CICSplex Transient
Data Summary attributes to review data about the number of buffer
waits, string waits, and the percentage of buffers and control intervals
in use.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The attributes within the CICSplex Transient Data
Summary group are stored for historical retrieval within the Tivoli
Data Warehouse. Selected attributes within this group are candidates
for the Tivoli Data Warehouse summarization and pruning features.</div>

<p id="attr_cicstds__TDWAIT"><strong>Buffer Waits</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the number of requests that are currently
suspended pending the availability of a transient data buffer.</span> The
value format is an integer of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstds__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the job name or modify ID of the
CICS region being monitored.</span> Each CICS region in a z/OS operating
system  has a unique name. This name is an alphanumeric string, with
a maximum of eight characters, and case-sensitive. CICS region names
are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstds__TDCWAITS"><strong>Current String Waits</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the current number of tasks that
require the physical reading or writing of a CI and are suspended
because of the lack of an available string.</span> The value format
is an integer of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstds__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID)
and CICS region name.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string,
maximum 32 characters, that is case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstds__TDSTRING"><strong>Percent Active Strings</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the percentage of available strings
currently being used for I/O to the intrapartition data set.</span> This
value is calculated by dividing the current string count by the total
number of strings. The value format is a percentage in the range of
0-100.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstds__TDBUF"><strong>Percent Buffers in Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the percentage of transient data
buffers in use.</span> This value is calculated by dividing the current
buffers in use by the total number of buffers. The value format is
a percentage in the range of 0-100.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstds__TDCIS"><strong>Percent CIs in Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the percentage used of the transient
data VSAM data set Control Intervals (CI).</span> When this value reaches
100%, if additional extents cannot be taken, because of lack of space
on eligible volumes or because secondaries have not been defined,
tasks issuing transient data write requests are terminated abnormally
for NOSPACE reasons unless the NOSPACE condition is explicitly handled
by the application. The value format is a percentage in the range
of 0-100.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstds__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the four character name that uniquely
identifies an active z/OS operating system within a given CICSplex.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum four characters, and
case-sensitive. z/OS System IDs are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstds__TDTWAITS"><strong>Total String Waits</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the total number of tasks that have
been suspended because of the lack of an available string since CICS
initialization.</span> The value format is an integer of maximum four
bytes.</p>
