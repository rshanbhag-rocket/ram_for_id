<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The situations in this category warn you of possible unit-of-work
problems, as raised by the CICS® Recovery
Manager.</p>

<div class="section"> <dl>
<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_RecMgr_Warning</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Current Shunted UOW Count greater
than 10. <p>The CICS Recovery Manager is reporting that there
are currently more than 10 units of work shunted for Indoubt. This indicates that the CICS region performance starts degrading unless remedial action
is taken relating to the reason for the shunted units of work. Use the unit-of-work queries
available within <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> to verify whether
the cause of failing transactions is related and the related Take Action commands to restore system
and application integrity.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of CICSplex_Recovery_Manager_Details.Current_Indoubt_shunted_UOWs is
greater than 10 then situation CICSplex_RecMgr_Warning is true.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_UOW_DSNFail_Warning</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Data set associated with this UOW has been shunted. <p>The unit of work associated with this
alert has been shunted because of a syncpoint failure associated with the specified data set. Note
that failures during syncpoint processing may result in locks being retained by the UOW. This may
result in system degradation if action is not taken to release the locked resources.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of CICSplex_Unit-of-work_DSN_Failure_Details.Dataset_name equals
blank then situation CICSplex_UOW_DSNFail_Warning is true.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_UOW_Link_Warning</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Resynchronization status is UNAVAILABLE or UNCONNECTED. <p>A distributed unit of work cannot
resynchronize itself because the connection to its link partner is either unconnected or
unavailable. To allow resynchronization to complete successfully, you must set the connection to the
remote system to Acquired.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of CICSplex_Unit-of-work_Link_Details.Resync_status equals
Unavailable or the value of CICSplex_Unit-of-work_Link_Details.Resync_status equals Unconnected then
situation CICSplex_UOW_Link_Warning is true.</p>
