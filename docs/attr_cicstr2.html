attributes report a breakdown of the time the transaction waited as
a result of I/O operations.</span> Use the CICSplex Transaction I/O
Waits Analysis attributes to determine which activity is contributing
excessively to the transaction's suspend time or overall elapsed time.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstr2__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each

the amount of time, (accurate to three decimal places) that the transaction
waited for all FEPI I/O services.</span> The value can be entered in
the HH:MM:SS.DDD format, for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD,
for example, 1200.567.  If you are using variable substitution, the
value in this example would display as 1200567.</p>

or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example, 1200.567.  If you are using variable
substitution, the value in this example would display as 1200567.</p>
