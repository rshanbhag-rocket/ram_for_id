<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The single predefined situation in this category monitors
the response time for an active group defined with OMEGAMON®. </p>

with CICSplex_Storage_Analysis. except where stated.</div>

<dd class="dlentry">Warning threshold exceeded for group response time. <p>Monitors for whether or not the response
time threshold stored in the OMEGAMON group definition
has been exceeded. It alerts the user whenever the response time threshold has been exceeded. This
situation uses an attribute from the Response Time Analysis group. This situation is distributed
automatically to the hub server; distribute it to all servers where <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> CICSplex is running.</p>

<p>Use the historical transaction display function of <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> to locate the transactions that have caused
an RTA threshold to be exceeded. The Bottleneck Analysis workspace can further assist you in
locating the wait reasons responsible for slow response times. If CPU bound transactions are unable
to get the processor resources they need, consider increasing the priority of either the transaction
or the CICS® region.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of CICSplex_Response_Time_Analysis.Exceeds_RTA_Threshold equals Yes
then situation Exceeds_RTA_Threshold is true.</p>
