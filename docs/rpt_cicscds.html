<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The predefined Dispatcher Summary workspace shows the level
of activity across the TCBs that CICS® runs.</p>

<div class="section"><p>It shows the start and stop time of given tasks, the peak
and current number of tasks, and the current number of TCBs that are
in use by the CICS region.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>This predefined workspace contains the following views:</p>
</div>

<div class="section"> <ul>
<li>Dispatcher Summary table view showing the attributes of the task
and transaction activity within each TCB. It shows the runaway task
intervals, and number of tasks active.</li>

<li>Dispatcher TCB Modes table view showing the all the TCB statistics
associated with each of the modes. There are several clocks that give
you the amount of real time used by either z/OS® waits or dispatches and also CPU time used
by either a task or a TCB.</li>

<li>Dispatcher TCB Pools table view. This shows the number of TCBs
that are allocated to a particular pool (JVM, OPEN, or HP), whether
they are attached or in use, as well as both the total and the current
waiting time associated with that pool. This groups the TCBs in a
logical way: it shows the number of current tasks that are waiting
and the peak number of tasks that have been waiting for each TCB.</li>
