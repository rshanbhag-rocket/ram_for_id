<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsfcs__CICSFCS"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex File Control Summary attribute
group provides a summary of the key attributes related to files.</span> Using
this data you can, for example, monitor the number of active strings
and compare them with the number of available strings.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The attributes within the CICSplex File Control Summary group
are stored for historical retrieval within the Tivoli Data Warehouse.
Selected attributes within this group are candidates for the Tivoli
Data Warehouse summarization and pruning features.</div>

<p id="attr_cicsfcs__ACTSTRNG"><strong>Active Strings</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the current number of updates against the file.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcs__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight  characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcs__ENASTA"><strong>Enable Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Specifies
whether application programs can access the file.</span> These are the
values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">DISABLED</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The file is not available for use by transactions except for those
that are currently using it. If there are any such users, 'BEING DISABLED'
is also displayed. The file can be re-enabled by a SET FILE ENABLED
command. It is not possible to disable a remote file.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">ENABLED</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The file is available for use by transactions and, if closed,
it is opened on the first request.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">UNENABLED</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The file is not available for use by transactions except for those
that are currently using it. If there are any such users, 'BEING CLOSED'
is also displayed. This status is the same as DISABLED except that
it occurs implicitly when a SET FILE CLOSE is requested. The file
is enabled implicitly by a SET FILE OPEN command.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsfcs__FILEACCE"><strong>File Access Method</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Returns a value identifying the access
method used with this data set.</span> These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">BDAM</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The access method is BDAM.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">NOTAPPLIC</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The data set has not been opened by the CICS region in which the
command is issued.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">VSAM</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The access method is VSAM. Access to a data table (except while
it is being loaded or, for a CICS-maintained data table, when the
source data set is being updated or searched for a record that is
not in the table), is through CICS data table services. Because this
access is still based on VSAM keys, CICS returns VSAM as the access
method for any kind of data table.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Data Table</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">This files represents a data table.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Remote</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The file is defined as remote, and therefore the access method
is not known to the local CICS system.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsfcs__FILEATTR"><strong>File Attributes</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Specifies
whether the file is to be accessed in RLS mode.</span> The file must
be closed, and either disabled or unenabled, to change the access
mode to RLS access or to non-RLS access. The non-RLS mode becomes
either LSR or NSR, depending on the value specified for LSRPOOLID
in the file resource definition.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcs__FILEID"><strong>File Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the name of the file.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcs__FILERECF"><strong>File Record Format</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the format of the records on the file.</span> These
are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">FB</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The records are of fixed length.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">U</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The format of records on the file is undefined. The Undefined
value is possible for BDAM data sets only.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">VB</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The records are of variable length. If the file is associated
with a user-maintained data table, the record format is always variable
length, even if the source data set contains fixed-length records.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsfcs__STRNGWAI"><strong>Number of String Waits</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total number of waits for strings
against the file.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcs__MAXSTRNG"><strong>Number of Strings</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the number of strings (concurrent operations) specified for the file
in its FILE definition.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcs__OPNSTA"><strong>Open Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Returns
a value identifying whether the file is open, closed, or in a transitional
state.</span> These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Close</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The file is closed.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Close in progress</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The file is in the process of being closed. Closing a file can
require dynamic deallocation of data sets and deletion of shared resources,
in which case close processing can last a significant length of time.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Notapplic</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The OPENSTATUS value does not apply to this type of file. For
example, it does not apply to a remote file.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Open</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The file is open.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Open in progress</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The file is in the process of being opened.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsfcs__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcs__REMSYSID"><strong>Remote System</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Returns
the name of the CICS region in which the file is defined (from the
REMOTESYSTEM value in the FILE definition).</span> Blanks are returned
if the file is not remote.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcs__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the four-character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum four characters, and case-sensitive. z/OS System IDs
are always in uppercase characters.</p>
