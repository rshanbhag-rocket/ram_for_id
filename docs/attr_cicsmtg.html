<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsmtg__CICSMTG"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string"> The CICSplex MVS TCB Global Details attribute
group reports on data related to start time, storage usage, and CPU
time of the CICS Task Control Blocks (TCBs). </span>This is retrieved
using the COLLECT STATISTICS DISPATCHER command.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__ASCPUTIME"><strong>Address Space CPU Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string"> Is the total CPU time (accurate to three
decimal places) accumulated by this CICS address space. </span> This
is obtained from the z/OS Address Space Control Block field ASCBEJST.
 The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format, for example,
00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example, 1200.567. If you are
using variable substitution, the value in this example would display
as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__ASSRBTIME"><strong>Address Space SRB Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string"> Is the total SRB time (accurate to three
decimal places) accumulated by this CICS address space so far.</span> This
is obtained from the z/OS Address Space Control Block field ASCBSRBT.
The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format, for example,
00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example, 1200.567. If you are
using variable substitution, the value in this example would display
as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name </strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string"> Is
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region that is being monitored. </span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__STTIME"><strong>CICS Start Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
time at which the CICS dispatcher started.</span>  This value is used
as an approximate time at which CICS started. The DFHSTUP report expresses
this time as hours:minutes:seconds.decimals; however, the DSECT field
contains the time as a store clock (STCK) value in GMT. This information
is obtained from the DISPATCHER statistics record DFHDSGDS and the
DSGSTART field.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__CTCOUNT"><strong>CICS TCB Count</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string"> Is
the number of TCBs currently present in the CICS address space that
are part of CICS, that is controlled by the CICS Dispatcher. </span> This
information is obtained from the z/OS TCB statistics record DFHDSTDS
field, DSTDS_CICSTCB_COUNT.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__CTCPUTIME"><strong>CICS TCB CPU Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the amount of CPU time (accurate to
three decimal places) that has been used by the TCBs currently present
in the CICS address space that are controlled by the CICS Dispatcher. </span> This
information is obtained from the z/OS TCB statistics record DFHDSTDS,
field DSTDS_CICSTCB_CPUTIME. The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD
format, for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example,
1200.567.  If you are using variable substitution, the value in this
example would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__CTSTGABOVE"><strong>CICS TCB Storage Above</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string"> Is the amount of private storage above
the 16M line currently allocated to TCBs currently present in the
CICS address space that are part of CICS, that is controlled by the
CICS Dispatcher. </span>This information is obtained from the z/OS TCB
statistics record DFHDSTDS field, DSTDS_CICSTCB_STG_ABOVE. </p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__CTSTGBELOW"><strong>CICS TCB Storage Below</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string"> Is the amount of private storage below
the 16M line currently allocated to TCBs currently present in the
CICS address space that are part of CICS, that is, controlled by the
CICS Dispatcher. </span>This information is obtained from the z/OS TCB
statistics record DFHDSTDS, field DSTDS_CICSTCB_STG_BELOW.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__ASCPUTINT"><strong>CPU Time since reset</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">  Is the CPU time (accurate to three decimal
places) accumulated by this CICS address space since the last statistics
reset.</span> This information is obtained from the DFHDSGDS DISPATCHER
statistics record in the DSGEJST field. The value can be entered in
the HH:MM:SS.DDD  format, for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD,
for example 1200.567.  If you are using variable substitution, the
value in this example would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__NCTCOUNT"><strong>Current non-CICS TCB count</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string"> Is the number of TCBs currently present
in the CICS address space that are not part of CICS, that is, not
controlled by the CICS dispatcher. </span>This information is obtained
from the z/OS TCB statistics record DFHDSTDS field, DSTDS_NONCICSTCB_COUNT.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__NCTCPUTIME"><strong>Non-CICS TCB CPU Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string"> Is the amount of CPU time (accurate to
three decimal places) that has been used by the TCBs currently present

z/OS TCB statistics record DFHDSTDS field, DSTDS_NONCICSTCB_STG_ABOVE.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__NCTSTGBELO"><strong>Non-CICS TCB Kbytes below 16M </strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the amount of private storage below

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtg__ASSRBTINT"><strong>Non-CICS TCB Kbytes below 16M </strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">SRB Time since reset Is the SRB time (accurate
