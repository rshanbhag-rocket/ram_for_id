<dd class="dlentry">Warning threshold exceeded for CICS® enqueue waits.
<p>Select the Enqueue Analysis view to find all tasks waiting on enqueues and the owners of the
serially reusable resources. If an enqueue is not being released, examine the owning task's resource
type to determine whether it is looping, waiting on a resource, or deadlocked with another task. You
can use the KILL command of <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> to
free the enqueue and allow the waiting tasks to continue. To limit the number of tasks suspended
because of enqueue conflicts, consider transaction classes.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of CICSplex_Region_Overview.Enqueue_Waits is greater than 5 and the
value of CICSplex_Region_Overview.Enqueue_Waits is less than or equal to 10 then situation
CICSplex_TotENQWaits_Warning is true.</p>
