<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsrmg__CICSRMG"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Recovery Manager Details
attribute group includes statistics about the performance of the CICS
recovery manager.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__CSHINDTO"><strong>Current Indoubt shunted time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total time that the units of work
are currently shunted for indoubt failures that have been waiting
in this condition.</span> This time value is measured accurate to three
decimal places. The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format,
for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example, 1200.567.
 If you are using variable substitution, the value in this example
would display as 1200567. </p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__CSHINDBT"><strong>Current Indoubt shunted UOWs</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the current number of units of work
that lost the connection to their recovery coordinator during syncpoint
processing, and have been shunted for indoubt failure.</span> A shunted
UOW is one awaiting resolution of these values: an indoubt failure,
a commit failure, or a backout failure.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__CSHRO"><strong>Current RO commit fail UOWs</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the current number of units of work
that have been shunted for commit or backout failure because a local
resource manager was not able to perform commit or backout processing
at this time on behalf of the UOW during syncpoint.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__CSGTRO"><strong>Current shunted RO commit fail time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total time that the units of work
currently shunted for commit or backout failures have been waiting

places. The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format, for example,
00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example, 1200.567.  If you are
using variable substitution, the value in this example would display
as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__IAFTR"><strong>Indoubt Actions Trandef</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total number of UOWs that were
forced to complete syncpoint processing because their transaction
definition specified that they could not wait indoubt.</span> </p>

<p>The UOWs are either committed or backed out according to the transaction
definition's indoubt action attribute, regardless of the actions specified
or taken by any other participating region in this distributed UOW.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__IAFTI"><strong>Indoubt Actions Timeout</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total number of shunted indoubt
UOWs that were forced to complete syncpoint processing because their
transaction definition wait for indoubt timeout value was exceeded.</span></p>

<p>The UOWs are either committed or backed out according to the transaction
definition's indoubt action attribute, regardless of the actions specified
or taken by any other participating region in this distributed UOW.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__IAFNW"><strong>Indoubt Actions No wait</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total number of UOWs that were
forced to complete syncpoint processing, despite having the ability
to wait indoubt, because a local resource owner or connected resource
manager used by the UOW was unable to wait indoubt.</span></p>

<p>The UOWs are either committed or backed out according to the transaction
definition's indoubt action attribute, regardless of the actions specified
or taken by any other participating region in this distributed UOW.
See the following section on no support for indoubt waiting breakdown.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__IAFOP"><strong>Indoubt Actions Operator</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total number of shunted indoubt
UOWs that were forced to complete syncpoint processing when a CEMT,
or EXEC CICS, SET UOW command was issued.</span></p>

<p>The UOWs are either committed or backed out according to the command
option, regardless of the actions specified or taken by any other
participating region in this distributed UOW.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__IAFOT"><strong>Indoubt Actions Other</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the number of UOW forced indoubt actions
that occurred because UOW uses recoverable facilities other than above
(for example, terminal RDO), which invalidate the ability to support
indoubt waiting.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__IAMIS"><strong>Indoubt Actions Mismatched</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total number of UOWs that were
forced to resolve using indoubt action mismatches.</span> This is the
total number of UOWs that were forced to resolve using an indoubt
action attribute, whether by definition, option or operator override
(as detailed in the above fields), and on so doing detected an indoubt
action attribute mismatch with a participating system or RMI. For
example, a participating system in a distributed UOW resolves its
work forward while other systems back out theirs. The opposite also
applies.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__NW61"><strong>No Waiting in LU61</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the number of UOW forces that occurred because the UOW uses an LU61
intersystem link, which cannot support indoubt waiting.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__NWMRO"><strong>No Waiting in MRO</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the number of UOW forces that occurred because the UOW uses an MRO
intersystem link to a downlevel CICS region, which cannot support
indoubt waiting.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__NWRMI"><strong>No Waiting in RMI</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the number of UOW forces that occurred because the UOW uses an RMI
(TRUEs) that declared an interest in syncpoint but could not support
indoubt waiting.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__NWTD"><strong>No Waiting in Transient data</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total number of UOWs that were
forced to complete syncpoint processing, despite having the ability
to wait indoubt, because a local resource owner or connected resource
manager used by the UOW was unable to wait for indoubt transient data.</span></p>

<p>The UOWs are either committed or backed out according to the transaction
definition's indoubt action attribute, regardless of the actions specified
or taken by any other participating region in this distributed UOW.
See the following section on no support for indoubt waiting breakdown.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__NWOTH"><strong>No waiting in other</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the number of UOW forces that occurred because the UOW uses recoverable
facilities other than above (for example, terminal RDO), which invalidate
the ability to support indoubt waiting.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsrmg__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>
