<dd class="dlentry">Exit program not connected. <p>The exit program associated with this alert is showing a
connection status other than CONNECTED. Check your exit program's connection status to determine
what is wrong. If needed, refer to the <em>IBM®
CICS® Transaction Server: System Programming Reference</em> for
guidance.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Connection_Status does not equal Connected then situation
CICSplex_ExitConn_Warning is true.</p>

<dd class="dlentry">Exit program is stopped. <p>The exit program associated with this alert is showing a Start
Status other than STARTED. A STOPPED status means the exit program is not available for execution;
that is, either an EXEC CICS ENABLE command with the START
option has not been issued or it has been revoked by the STOP option. Issue an EXEC CICS ENABLE command to start your exit program.</p>
