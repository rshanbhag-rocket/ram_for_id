<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicslpd__CICSLPD"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex
LSR Pool Details attribute group provides information about a specific
Local Shared Resource (LSR) pool that has been built in CICS for VSAM
files and their impact on performance.</span></p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The attributes within the CICSplex LSR Pool Details
group are stored for historical retrieval within the Tivoli Data Warehouse.
Selected attributes within this group are candidates for the Tivoli
Data Warehouse summarization and pruning features.</div>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the job name or modify ID of the
CICS region being monitored.</span> Each CICS region in a z/OS operating
system  has a unique name. This name is an alphanumeric string, with
a maximum of eight characters, and case-sensitive. CICS region names
are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__BUFNUM"><strong>Buffer Number</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of buffers used by the local shared
resource pool.</span> The value format is an integer of maximum four
bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__BUFREAD"><strong>Buffer Reads</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of buffer reads, which is number
of times a control interval has to be read from disk.</span> The value
format is an integer of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__BUFREAD8"><strong>Buffer Reads 8</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of buffer reads, which is number of times a control
interval has to be read from disk.</span> The value format is an integer of maximum eight bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__BUFSIZE"><strong>Buffer Size</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The local shared resource pool buffer size.</span> The
value format is an integer of maximum two bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__BUFTYPE"><strong>Buffer Type</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The type of hiperspace buffer, whether index or data, that is in
use. Valid values:</span> Data=D, Index=I</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__BUFWRITE"><strong>Buffer Writes</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of buffer WRITEs for the logical
shared resource pool.</span> The value format is an integer of maximum
four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__HBUFNUM"><strong>Hiperspace Buffers</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of hiperspace buffers used for the
logical shared resource pool.</span> The value format is an integer
of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__HBUFRDF"><strong>Hiperspace Reads Failed</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of hiperspace buffer reads that
failed for the logical shared resource pool.</span> The value format
is an integer of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__HBUFWRF"><strong>Hiperspace Writes Failed</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of hiperspace buffer WRITE requests
that failed for the logical shared resource pool.</span> The value format
is an integer of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__BUFLAHIT"><strong>Lookaside Hits</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of look-aside hits, successful read requests that VSAM
was able to satisfy without initiating an I/O operation; that is, the requested index record was
already present in one of the buffer resident Control Intervals.</span> The value format is an integer
of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__BUFLAHIT8"><strong>Lookaside Hits 8</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of look-aside hits, successful read requests that VSAM
was able to satisfy without initiating an I/O operation; that is, the requested index record was
already present in one of the buffer resident Control Intervals.</span> The value format is an integer
of maximum eight bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__BUFRATIO"><strong>Lookaside Ratio</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the percentage of VSAM read requests that were satisfied
without initiating I/O because the Control Interval (CI) was already resident in the buffer
pool.</span> The value format is a percentage in the range of 0-100.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__BUFNUWRI"><strong>Non User Buffer Writes</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of non user buffer WRITEs for the
logical shared resource pool.</span> The value format is an integer
of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and
CICS region name.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string,
maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p>This value is computed by dividing the number of active strings
by the total number of strings.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__POOLID"><strong>Pool ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Identifies
the LSR pool.</span> The value format is an integer of maximum two bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__HBUFREAD"><strong>Successful Hiperspace Reads</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of successful hiperspace buffer
reads used for the logical shared resource pool.</span> The value format
is an integer of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__HBUFWRIT"><strong>Successful Hiperspace Writes</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of successful hiperspace buffer
WRITE requests used for the logical shared resource pool.</span> The
value format is an integer of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslpd__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the four character name that uniquely
identifies an active z/OS operating system within a given CICSplex.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum four characters, and
case-sensitive. z/OS System IDs are always in uppercase characters.</p>
