<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The TCPIP Statistics workspace is used to monitor the activity
of your CICS® regions' TCP/IP
connections. The statistics report the volume of inbound and outbound
activity. These statistics can be accessed online using the EXEC CICS COLLECT STATISTICS TCPIP command.</p>

<div class="section"><p>You can use this workspace to warn you when the MAXSOCKETS
value is being reached by comparing the Maximum sockets limit with
the Current inbound and outbound sockets. Alternatively you can set
a threshold to warn you when the number of times that MAXSOCKETS has
been reached or if any time outs have occurred while at MAXSOCKETS.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>The predefined TCPIP Statistics workspace contains the
following views:</p>
</div>

<div class="section"> <ul>
<li>The Inbound Socket Activity bar chart compares the current inbound
sockets, the number of inbound sockets created, and the peak number
of inbound sockets.</li>

<li>The Outbound Socket Activity bar chart compares the current outbound
sockets, current persistent sockets outbound, the number of outbound
sockets closed, the number of outbound sockets created, the peak number
of outbound sockets, and the peak number of persistent sockets outbound.</li>

<li>The TCP/IP Statistics table view displays maximum number of sockets
available and reports current and peak number of sockets in use for
both inbound and outbound activity. It also reports current and peak
number of persistent sockets in use for both inbound and outbound
activity. To help monitor the performance of your system it reports
the number of times at MAXSOCKETS, the total, current and peak number
delayed at MAXSOCKETS, and the total and current delay time at MAXSOCKETS.
The SLSCache setting, and the current active SSL sockets and the maximum
number of SSL TCBs is displayed. The average and current MAXSOCKETS
delay time is calculated.</li>

<li>The TCP/IP Service Statistics table view lists the status, the
service open, TCP/IP service IP address, the port number in use, the
protocol, the backlog, the attach time security, SSL type, client
authentication, TCP/IP Service privacy, TCP/IP Service WLM DNS group,
TCP/IP service prefix, transaction ID, URM, number of transactions,
current and peak number of transactions, the number of sends and receives,
and the number of bytes sent and received for each TCP/IP service. </li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>You can link to the Application TCP Listeners workspace
provided by the <span class="keyword">OMEGAMON for Mainframe Networks</span> product
to investigate the TCP/IP stack, filtered by the CICS Application Name.</p>
