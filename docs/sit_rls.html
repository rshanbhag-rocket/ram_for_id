<dd class="dlentry">Monitors the existence of locks on RLS resources. It issues an alert whenever it detects a task
that is holding an RLS resource. This situation uses attributes from the CICSplex RLS Lock Analysis
group. This situation is distributed automatically to the *hub <span class="keyword">Tivoli Monitoring Server</span>; distribute it to all <span class="keyword">Tivoli Monitoring Server</span>s where <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> is running. <p>Use the RLS Lock Analysis
workspace to find any tasks that can be waiting for an RLS lock to become available. If a lock is
not being released, use the Transaction Analysis workspace to display the owning task's wait type to
determine whether it is looping, waiting on a resource, or deadlocked with another task. You can
invoke the CEKL command using the Take Action feature to free the lock and allow waiting tasks to
continue. To limit the number of lock conflicts, consider transaction classes.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Task_State equals H and the value of Time_in_Suspend_Numeric is
greater than or equal to 60 then situation CICSRegion_Held_RLS_Locks is true.</p>
