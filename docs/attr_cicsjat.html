   <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Journal Analysis attribute group provides
    information about the system log and the general logs.</span> It includes all of the statistics
   and failure codes currently offered by the <span class="keyword">OMEGAMON AI for CICS</span> (3270) interface.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__JRNLAVGW"><strong>Average Bytes Written</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The average number of bytes written to
this journal per request.</span> If the journal is a System Log, this
field contains the n/a value; the statistics for System Logs are kept
with their associated Log Stream.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__JRNLFLUS"><strong>Buffer Flushes</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
number of buffer flush requests issued for this journal.</span> If the
journal is a System Log, this field contains the n/a value; the statistics
for System Logs are kept with their associated Log Stream.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__JRNLBYTE"><strong>Bytes Written</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
number of bytes written to this journal.</span> If the journal is a
System Log, this field contains the n/a value; the statistics for
System Logs are kept with their associated Log Stream.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__JRNLFAIL"><strong>Failure Reason</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Provides
the reason behind a log stream error when the Journal Status column
indicates the journal has failed.</span> These are the values:</p>

<ul>
<li>System log conflict</li>

<li>Journal has failed</li>

<li>Error opening log</li>

<li>Unable to create</li>

<li>n/a</li>

</ul>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__JRNLNAME"><strong>Journal Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the eight character name of the CICS journal.</span> The value format
is an alphanumeric string of maximum eight characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__JRNLSTAT"><strong>Journal Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the connection status of the journal.</span> These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Ena Conn</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Journal is enabled and connected. It is mapped onto a z/OS log
stream. Only user journals can have this status.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Ena Disc</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Journal is enabled but disconnected. It is no longer mapped onto
a z/OS log stream. DFHLOG, DFHSHUNT, file control forward recovery
logs, and auto journals typically display with the Enabled Disconnected
status, even if the stream name is in use.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Failed</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Journal has experienced a log stream failure. It cannot be used
until it is re-enabled.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Unknown</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The status of the journal cannot be determined.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Disabled</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Journal has been disabled. It cannot be used until it is re-enabled.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__JRNLTYPE"><strong>Journal Type</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the type of journal.</span> These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Dummy</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">No log records are written to a z/OS log stream.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">MVS</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Journal records are written to a z/OS log stream.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">SMF</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Journal records are written in SMF format to the z/OS SMF log.
Note that the SMF type is not used for the CICS system log or for
forward recovery logs.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Unknown</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The type of journal cannot be determined.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__JRNLLOGN"><strong>MVS Log Stream Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The name of the z/OS log stream to which
the journal is mapped.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string
of maximum 26 characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__JRNLSTLR"><strong>Statistics Last Reset</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the last time that journal statistics
were reset, possibly because of interval statistics collection.</span> If
the journal is a System Log, this field contains the n/a value; the
statistics for System Logs are kept with their associated Log Stream.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the four character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum four characters, and case-sensitive. z/OS System IDs
are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__JRNLSLOG"><strong>System Log</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
whether the journal is a system log.</span> There can be only one system
log in each CICS region. These are the values: Yes or No.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__JRNLWAIT"><strong>WTOR Wait</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
whether or not the journal has a current status of Waiting for an
Outstanding WTOR (Write-To-Operator-with-Reply).</span> When a journal
becomes full, a WTOR is sent to the system console, and the journal's
status is set to waiting for an outstanding WTOR if the Switch option
is set to Pause in the journal control table (JCT). In this case,
respond immediately to the WTOR to confirm that an existing journal
can be reused and overwritten because CICS transactions using a journal
with this status cannot continue until the WTOR is resolved. This
attribute only applies to CICS version 4 and earlier. These are the
valid values: Yes or No.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjat__JRNLWRIT"><strong>Write Requests</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
number of write requests for this journal.</span> If the journal is
a System Log, this field contains the n/a value; the statistics for
