<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_DSAHigh_Warning</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Warning threshold exceeded for high DSA usage. <p>Consider increasing the size of the CICS® region and make the DSA larger. Increase the region size
only, if the Region Overview workspace shows adequate LSQA to support the change. It is also worth
checking the current OSCOR usage. If the DSA size cannot be increased, consider reducing the CICS MAXTASK value.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Percent_Used is greater than 70 and the value of Percent_Used is
less than or equal to 90 and the value of Area equals DSA then situation CICSplex_DSAHigh_Warning is
true.</p>

indicate an excessive DSA size. Decrease the size of the DSA for the CICS region. If there are very few tasks, there might be very little DSA in
use. Consider increasing the maximum number of tasks (MXT CICS can process at one time).</p>

are al located in units of 256KB. The exception to this is the user DSA which is 1MB when storage
isolation is active. Change the DSALIM parameter for the CICS
address space to increase the storage available to CICS.</p>
