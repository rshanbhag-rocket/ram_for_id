<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_ClassMax_Warning</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Warning threshold exceeded for class MAXTASK. <p>Generally, your application must add
transactions to a transaction class to restrict access to resources in CICS®. If response time is not acceptable, it can be necessary to reevaluate
why the task has been placed in a transaction class. If you determine that the class MAXTASK value
is too low, you can change it with either <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> or the CICS CEMT transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Percent_of_Limit is greater than 80 and the value of
Percent_of_Limit is less than or equal to 90 then situation CICSplex_ClassMax_Warning is
true.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_ClassMax_Critical</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Critical threshold exceeded for class MAXTASK. <p>Generally, your application must add

<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_AtClassMax_Warning</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Warning threshold exceeded for class MAXTASK limit. <p>When the limit is reached for a class, a
new task belonging to the same class cannot be run until an old task has terminated. Use the
Transaction Analysis workspace to determine whether a problem is preventing tasks within the
specified class from completing in a timely manner. For example, tasks can be waiting for an
enqueue, or CICS itself can be short-on-storage. If you find
that the class MAXTASK value is too low, you might change it with either <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> or the CICS CEMT transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Percent_of_Limit is greater than or equal to 100 then situation
