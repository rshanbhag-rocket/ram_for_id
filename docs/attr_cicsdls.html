<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsdls__CICSDLS"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The DBCTL Summary
attributes report on the status of the CICS database control (DBCTL)
interface for each monitored CICS region.</span></p>

<p>Use the DBCTL Summary attributes in situations to determine if
DBCTL is active. These attributes provide data for the DBCTL Summary
table view.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCDRMCT"><strong>Active Thread RMI Calls</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of active threads that are processing
DBCTL Resource Manager Interface (RMI) calls.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the job name or modify ID of the
CICS region being monitored.</span> Each CICS region in a z/OS operating
system  has a unique name. This name is an alphanumeric string, with
a maximum of eight  characters, and case-sensitive. CICS region names
are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCCONST"><strong>Connection Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The status of the DBCTL connection: connected
or unconnected.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCCTIME"><strong>Connect Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The timestamp of when CICS connected to DBCTL.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCTLACT"><strong>DBCTL Active</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates whether or not the CICS Database
Control facility for IMS (DBCTL) is active.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCJOBNM"><strong>DBCTL Job name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The name of the DBCTL job that is connected
to CICS.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCJOBI"><strong>DBCTL Job number</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of the DBCTL job that is connected
to CICS.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCRSENM"><strong>DBCTL RSE name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The name of the Recoverable Service Element
(RSE) DBCTL job.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCTLID"><strong>DBCTL Subsystem Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The subsystem identifier associated with DBCTL.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBMONACT"><strong>DLI DB Monitor Active</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates whether or not the DL/I Database
Monitor is active.</span> The DB Monitor has high overhead and can potentially
impact both DL/I and CICS performance.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DMBPCT"><strong>DLI Percent DMB Pool Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Percentage used of the Data Management Block
(DMB) storage pool.</span> The DMB pool is acquired from the CICS dynamic
storage area and should be set large enough to accommodate all DMBs
used in CICS, including shared databases. If the pool is not large
enough, operating system close/open of databases can become necessary
to service new database requests. The value format is a percentage
in the range 0 - 100.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__ENQPCT"><strong>DLI Percent ENQ Pool Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">DL/I enqueue pool usage expressed as a percentage.</span> The
maximum amount of storage that can be used is set by the ENQPL parameter
of the SIT. PI enqueue pool storage is GETMAINed out of OSCOR, and
a transaction that cannot be serviced because of an OSCOR shortage
or because the ENQPL maximum has been reached is terminated with a
U0775 abend. The value format is a percentage in the range 0 - 100.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__PSBPCT"><strong>DLI Percent PSB Pool Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Percentage used of the Program Specification
Block (PSB) storage pool.</span> The PSB pool is acquired from the CICS
dynamic storage area and should be set large enough to accommodate
all PSBs used in CICS, including shared databases. If the pool is
not large enough, operating system close/open of databases can become
necessary to service new database requests. The value format is a
percentage in the range 0 - 100.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__THRPCT"><strong>DLI Percent Thread Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Percentage of IMS DL/I threads in use.</span> When
this value reaches 100%, tasks are placed in a wait condition until
threads become available. The value format is a percentage in the
range 0 - 100.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCELMAX"><strong>Elapsed Time at Maximum Threads</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The elapsed time the connection was at the
maximum thread level during the last session.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCMATHD"><strong>Maximum Threads</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The maximum number of threads available for
DBCTL processing.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCMATHH"><strong>Maximum Thread Hits</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The peak number of times the maximum thread
level was hit during the last session.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCMITHD"><strong>Minimum Threads</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The minimum number of threads available for
DBCTL processing.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCMITHH"><strong>Minimum Thread Hits</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The peak number of times the minimum thread
level was hit during the last session.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The combination of CICS z/OS System ID (SMFID)
and CICS region name.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string,
maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCPTCBS"><strong>Peak Number of Threads</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The high water mark allocated for DBCTL processing
during the session.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdls__DBCRMIST"><strong>RMI Adapter Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The status of the DBCTL Resource Manager Interface
(RMI) adapter.</span> The status can be active (Y) or inactive (N).</p>
