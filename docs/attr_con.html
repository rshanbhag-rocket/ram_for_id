<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Connection Analysis attributes help you determine the
efficiency of multiregion operation (MRO) and intersystem communication (ISC) links between regions
within a selected CICS region.</span> Use the CICSplex Connection Analysis attributes in situations to
analyze the balance of work across connected Application-Owning Regions (AORs) and the routing of
transactions from any Terminal-Owning Region (TOR) to connected regions.</p>

<p>These attributes provide data for the Connections Analysis table views.</p>
