<dd class="dlentry">Virtual host definition is disabled. <p>The virtual host associated with this alert is showing a
status other than ENABLED. A disabled status means that the URIMAP definitions that make up the
virtual host cannot be accessed by applications. Check your virtual host definitions to ensure that
the virtual host is enabled, and either enable it or redefine your URIMAP as necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of CICSplex_Virtual_Host_Detail.Status does not equal Enabled then
situation CICSplex_HostStatus_Warning is true.</p>

<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_URIMAPDisCnt_Warning</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">URIMAP definition disabled during request. <p>The URIMAP associated with this alert is showing a
disabled count greater than zero. One or more requests against the host and path associated with
this URIMAP were made while the URIMAP was disabled. Check your URIMAP definitions to ensure the
URIMAP is enabled; consider enabling or redefining your URIMAP if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of CICSplex_URIMAP_Summary.Disable_count is greater than 0 then

<dd class="dlentry">The URIMAP's associated virtual hosts are disabled. <p>The URIMAP associated with this alert is
showing a Virtual Host Disabled count greater than zero. This means that at least one search was
made for a host and path for which the URIMAP definition was found, but the virtual host associated
with the URIMAP was disabled. Check your virtual host definitions to ensure that the virtual host
exists and that it is enabled. If necessary, consider redefining your URIMAP.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of CICSplex_URIMAP_Global.Hosts_disabled is greater than 0 then
situation CICSplex_URIMAPHostDis_Warning is true.</p>

<dd class="dlentry">URIMAP definition is disabled or unavailable. <p>The URIMAP associated with this alert is
showing a status other than ENABLED. The URIMAP definition may be disabled or unavailable because
its virtual host has been disabled. Check your URIMAP and Virtual Host definitions to ensure that
the URIMAP and its associated virtual host are enabled. If necessary, enable or redefine the
definitions.</p>

<dd class="dlentry">URIMAP HOST/PATH search has failed. <p>The URIMAP associated with this alert is showing an
unmatched count greater than zero. This means that at least one search was made for a matching
URIMAP definition for which no host and path could be found. Review your current URIMAP definitions
to ensure the host and path specifications are correct.</p>
