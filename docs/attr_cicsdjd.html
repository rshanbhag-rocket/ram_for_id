<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsdjd__CICSDJD"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">This attribute group retrieves information
about a DJAR definition.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdjd__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight  characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdjd__DJARNAME"><strong>DJAR Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the file name of the current DJAR.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdjd__CORBASERVR"><strong>Corbaserver Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the identifier of the parent CORBA
server.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdjd__HFSFILE"><strong>HFS File Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the fully qualified HFS file name.</span> If this DJAR definition was
created by performing the SCAN function on a CORBA server definition,
this fully qualified HFS file name is the one that shows in the DJARDIR
parameter of that CORBA server definition.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdjd__LASTMODTIM"><strong>Last Modified Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the timestamp of the latest updated
to this DJAR on HFS, displayed in your workstation's locale.</span> The
last-modified-time can be used to determine whether CICS has refreshed
itself after an update is made to a JAR in the pickup directory.</p>

<p>For dynamically-installed DJARs (those installed by the CICS scanning
mechanism), the value of LASTMODTIME is the timestamp of the HFS file
pointed to by the DJAR definition, at the time the DJAR definition
was last installed or updated.</p>

<p>For statically-installed DJARs (those installed from a CSD or by
CREATE DJAR), the value of LASTMODTIME is the timestamp of the HFS
file pointed to by the DJAR definition, at the time the DJAR was installed.
The value is fixed--it cannot be updated like a dynamically-installed
DJAR.</p>

<p>If you issue an INQUIRE DJAR command before a newly installed or
updated DJAR has fully initialized, the returned LASTMODTIME value
is zero.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdjd__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdjd__STATE"><strong>State</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the
indicator to show the state of the DJAR file.</span> These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Discarding</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">A DISCARD is in progress for this deployed jar file.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Initializing</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The jar file is being copied to the shelf.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Inservice</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Resolution of the copy of the jar file on the shelf has succeeded,
and the deployed jar file is usable.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Pending Initialization</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Copying of the jar file to the shelf has not yet started.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Pending Resolving</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Resolution of the copy of the jar file on the shelf has not yet
started</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Resolving</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The copy of the jar file on the shelf is being resolved</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Unresolved</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Resolution of the copy of the jar file on the shelf has failed,
and the deployed jar file is unusable.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Unusable</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Copying the jar file to the shelf has failed, and the deployed
jar file is unusable.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsdjd__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the four-character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum four characters, and case-sensitive. z/OS System IDs
are always in uppercase characters.</p>
