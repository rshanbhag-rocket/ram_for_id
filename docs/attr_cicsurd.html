<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsurd__CICSURD"></span>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex URIMAP Detail attribute group provide resource
definitions that match the URIs of HTTP or Web service requests, and provide information on how to
process the requests.</span> The URIMAP definitions are used to provide these different Web-related
facilities in CICS:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requests from a Web client, to CICS as an HTTP server.</li>

<li>Requests to a server, from CICS as an HTTP client.</li>

<li>Web service requests.</li>

</ul>

<p id="attr_cicsurd__ANALYZER"><strong>Analyzer</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Specifies whether an analyzer program is to be used in processing
the HTTP request.</span> The analyzer using this attribute is the analyzer associated with the
TCPIPSERVICE definition or definitions to which this URIMAP definition relates. An analyzer program
must be in the local CICS region. These are the values:</p>

<dl>

<dt class="dlterm">NO</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Means that the analyzer is not used.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">YES</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Runs the analyzer.</dd>


</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsurd__ATOMSERV"><strong>Atom Service</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The resource definition that is used to specify where CICS obtains
the data to produce Atom documents in response to a HTTP request.</span> This name is an alphanumeric
string, with a maximum of eight characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsurd__CERTIF"><strong>Certificate</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the label of the certificate that is to be used as the SSL client
certificate for the HTTP request by CICS as an HTTP client.</span> It specifies the label of the
X'509' certificate that is to be used as the SSL client certificate during the SSL handshake.
Certificate labels are up to 32 characters in length. This attribute is only used when the URI
specified by the URIMAP definition is to be used for an HTTPS request made by CICS as a client. It
is up to the server to request a SSL client certificate, and if this happens, CICS supplies the
certificate label which is specified in the URIMAP definition. If this attribute is omitted, the
default certificate defined in the key ring for the CICS region user ID is used. The certificate
must be stored in a key ring in the database of the external security manager.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsurd__CIPHERS"><strong>Ciphers</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the list of cipher suite codes specified for the URIMAP.</span> It
specifies a string of up to 56 hexadecimal digits that is interpreted as a list of up to 28 two
digit cipher suite codes. When you use CEDA to define the resource, CICS automatically initializes
the attribute with a default list of acceptable codes, depending on the level of encryption that is
specified by the ENCRYPTION system initialization parameter. </p>

<p id="attr_cicsurd__CHARSET"><strong>Character Set</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the name of the character set to be used for the static
response.</span> It specifies the 1 to 40 character name of the character set into which CICS converts
the entity body of the response that is sent to the Web client. CICS does not support all the
character sets named by IANA. HTML coded character sets list the IANA character sets that are
supported by CICS.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsurd__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being

always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsurd__CONVERTR"><strong>Converter program</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the name of the URIMAP converter program.</span> It specifies the
one thru eight character name of a converter program that is to be run to perform conversion or
other processing on the request and response. Typically, a converter program transforms the HTTP
request into a COMMAREA that is used by an application program, and transforms the output into an
HTTP response. The converter program is any converter program that is available in the local CICS
region.</p>

that forms the body of the static response which is sent to the HTTP request from the Web
client.</p>

request must be redirected.</span> This must be a complete URL, including scheme, host, and path
components, and appropriate de limiters. CICS does not check that the URL is valid, so you must
ensure that the destination exists and that the URL is specified correctly.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsurd__MEDIATYPE"><strong>Media Type</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Specifies the media type (data content) of the static response that
CICS provides to the HTTP request.</span></p>

name.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name in the attribute to the names
of managed systems assigned to the item. If the origin node name matches the name of a managed
system, the status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin node and the managed
systems do not match, the status of the item remains unchanged.</p>
