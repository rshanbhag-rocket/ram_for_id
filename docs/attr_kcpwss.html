<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Average response-time goals: If you specify the response time
goal of a service class as an average response time, the performance
index measures how close the response time for the service class is
to the response time goal. The performance index is calculated by
dividing the actual average response time by the response time goal.
When the average response time equals the response time goal, the
performance index is displayed as 1.00. <p>For example, if the average
response time for a service class is 1.5 seconds and the response
time goal is two seconds, then the performance index is 0.75.</p>
</div>

<p>If you specify the response time goal as a <strong>Percent of Goal</strong> (also
known as a percentile goal), the performance index measures whether
the percentage of transactions specified in the goal meets the response
time goal.</p>

<p>When a task completes, it is calculated in one of the following
percent-of-goal buckets: 50% or less, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 110%,
120%, 130%, 140%, 150%, 200%, 400%, or greater than 400%. This is
based on its actual response time compared with the goal response
time. The performance index is calculated by locating the percent-of-goal
bucket with a cumulative total equal to or higher than the percent
of goal for the service class. The cumulative total is the sum of
the number of transactions for each bucket, from lowest to highest.</p>

<p>Example: Assume the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The response time goal for a service class is 80% of all transactions
completing within 3 seconds.</li>

<li>10 transactions complete within the time interval as follows:
The first three transactions average 1.5 seconds (50% of goal); the
second three average 2.9 seconds (90% of goal); the third three average
six seconds (200% of goal); and the last transaction completes in
99 seconds (400% of goal).</li>

<li>The total transaction count is 10. Eighty percent of the total
transaction count is eight.</li>

</ul>

<p>Adding from lowest to highest, the eighth transaction occurs in
the 200% bucket. The performance index is, therefore, 2.00. Note that
the transaction in the &gt;400% bucket does not affect the performance
index.</p>
