<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Transaction Details attributes provide detailed
information about a running transaction.</span> Use the CICSplex Transaction Details attributes to see
how much CPU and storage the task is using, and to determine its current state. High CPU and storage
consumption are indicators of a looping task which can seriously degrade performance. A looping task
can lock up the entire CICS region, or exhaust available CICS storage causing a short on storage
condition.</p>

<p>If you want to view how the task has spent its time so far, select the Transaction Timings link
in the Transaction Analysis workspace. If you want to see details about the amount of storage a task
is currently using or statistics about the storage it has used throughout its life, select the
Transaction Storage Analysis link in Transaction Analysis workspace.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstrd__ATCHTIME"><strong>Attach Time</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the date and time when the transaction was

<p id="attr_cicstrd__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being

this task.</span></p>

the transaction was attached.</span> The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format, for example,
00:20:00.567, or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example 1200.567. If you are using variable substitution, the
value in this example would display as 1200567. See the online help for more details on variable
substitution or inputting values in situations and filters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstrd__ELAPTIM_MS"><strong>Elapsed Time</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the amount of time (in seconds) the transaction had been

time).</span></p>

name.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name in the attribute to the names
of managed systems assigned to the item. If the origin node name matches the name of a managed
system, the status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin node and the managed
systems do not match, the status of the item remains unchanged.</p>
