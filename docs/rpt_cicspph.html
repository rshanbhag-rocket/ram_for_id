<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Pagepool Summary workspace reports the status of storage
areas in your CICS® regions.
There are a large number of attributes associated with the views and
they all provide good tuning opportunities. If you need more information
about specific details, use the Pagepool Details table view.</p>

<div class="section"><p>Because of the large number of attributes in this group
you might want to regroup them, and, in some cases, delete them from
your view. As with all the table views, you can either unmark the
columns by right-clicking or slide them to the upper left or upper
right within the table.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>The predefined Pagepool Summary workspace contains the
following views:</p>
</div>

<div class="section"> <ul>
<li>The DSA Storage Utilization bar chart shows the current usage,
current limit, current total and the current high water mark.</li>

<li>The EDSA Storage Utilization bar chart shows the current usage,
current limit, current total and the current high water mark.</li>

<li>The Pagepool Summary table view shows an overview of the Unique
and Common subspace users (current, total, HWM) for each CICS region. It also includes current storage
area Usage, Limit and Total size, in both kilobytes and megabytes.
 <p> You can regroup these attributes and in some cases delete them
from your view. As with all the table views, you can either unmark
the columns by right-clicking or slide them to the upper left or upper
right within the table.</p>
</li>

<li>The Pagepool Details table view shows a large number of attributes
relating to the storage areas of your CICS regions.
Using this table you monitor the number of  short-on-storage (SOS)
occurrences and the total SOS time, the DSA Use percentage, DSA usage,
HWM, LWM, amount of free space, cushion size, and the number of GETMAIN
and FREEMAIN requests for each region.  <p> The Pagepool details table
reports the status of storage areas in your CICS regions; it extends the information collected
in the Storage Analysis workspace. There are a large number of attributes
associated with the views and they all provide good tuning opportunities. </p>
 <p> It
is through this table that you monitor the total number of storage
violations in the last hour and the number of times that your CICS regions went short on storage.
You can set up a threshold to sound an alert if the storage areas
use percentage is reaching a critical level. Alternatively you might
want to set up a situation that automatically increases the size of
the storage area while you investigate the cause of the problem. </p>
 <p> You
can use this table to investigate the causes of the problem as it
gives details about the number of suspensions, cushions, extents,
GETMAIN, and FREEMAIN requests for each region. </p>
