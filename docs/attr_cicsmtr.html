<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsmtr__CICSMTR"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex MVS TCB Resource Details
attribute group reports addresses, storage, tasks, and transactions
running on a CICS TCB.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__CICSTASK"><strong>CICS Task Number</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the CICS task number (1 to 99999) of the current task running on this
TCB, if any.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__TYPE"><strong>CICS TCB</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Specifies
whether this is a CICS owned TCB or not.</span> CICS owned TCBs are
the CICS job step TCB and those that were attached by CICS system
code. Non CICS TCBs are those that were attached by other products
in the CICS address space.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__CPU"><strong>CPU Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the
accumulated CPU time (accurate to three decimal places) for this TCB,
taken from the TCBTTIME TCB field.</span> The value can be entered in
the HH:MM:SS.DDD  format, for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD,
for example, 1200.567.  If you are using variable substitution, the
value in this example would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__CPUPC"><strong>CPU percent</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the percentage of the CPU time for all current TCBs of this type (CICS
or non-CICS) that this TCB has taken.</span> Note that only currently
attached TCBs are listed; there might have been others that have ended.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__DAUGHTER"><strong>Daughter TCB</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the address of this TCB's daughter TCB, that is, one that it attached.</span> The
range that is allotted is 0 to No limit. </p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__MOTHER"><strong>Mother TCB</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the address of this TCB's mother TCB, that is, the one that attached
it.</span> The range that is allotted is 0 to No limit.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__STGBELOW"><strong>Private Storage Below 16M</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the amount of private storage below
the 16 megabyte line currently allocated to this TCB.</span> This consists
of whole pages allocated to the TCB by z/OS. Each page typically contains
bytes that are not in use (have not been returned in response to a
GETMAIN request) and are only available to GETMAIN requests from this
TCB.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__STGABOVE"><strong>Private Storage Above 16M</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the amount of private storage above
the 16 megabyte line currently allocated to this TCB.</span> This consists
of whole pages allocated to the TCB by z/OS. Each page typically contains
bytes that are not in use (have not been returned in response to a
GETMAIN request) and are only available to GETMAIN requests from this
TCB.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__SISTER"><strong>Sister TCB</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the address of this TCB's sister TCB, that is, the next one attached
by its mother.</span> The range that is allotted is 0 to No limit.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the four character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum four characters, and case-sensitive. z/OS System IDs
are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__RUNSTAT"><strong>Task Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the run status of the CICS task on this TCB.</span> These are the possible
values: DISPATCHABLE, RUNNING or SUSPENDED.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__ADDR"><strong>TCB Address</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the address of the z/OS Task Control Block (TCB).</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__NAME"><strong>TCB Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the
name of TCB, such as QR, RO, DFHTRTCB for CICS owned TCBs otherwise
the value non CICS is used for TCBs running in the CICS address space
but not owned by CICS.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsmtr__TRANID"><strong>Transaction Identifier</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the transaction ID of the CICS task
