<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicscos__CICSCOS"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Connections Summary attributes
helps you analyze the efficiency of multiregion operation (MRO), intersystem
communication (ISC), and IP interconnections (IPCONN) links and detect
capacity constraints that could cause bottlenecks.</span>          
                                                                 
                       </p>

<p id="attr_cicscos__ALLOTOT"><strong>Allocation Count</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the total count of allocate requests for this type of connection.</span> The
maximum number of requests that originate in this region that can
be queued.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscos__ALLORATP"><strong>Allocation Percentage</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the percentage of link allocations
across connections of this type.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscos__ALLORATE"><strong>Allocation Rate</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the rate per minute at which link allocations are occurring across
connections of this type.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscos__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters. CICS
region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscos__VTAMAPPL"><strong>CICS Region VTAM Applid</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the eight character name for the specific
VTAM applid of the CICS region.</span></p>

<p> A CICS system's specific applid is used to distinguish between
the pair of XRF systems. It is the name quoted on  a VTAM APPL statement,
to identify this CICS to VTAM. </p>

<p id="attr_cicscos__VTAMGAPL"><strong>CICS Region VTAM Generic Applid</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the eight character name for the generic
CICS VTAM Applid of the CICS region.</span>CICS systems that use XRF
can have a generic name. The name is specified on the  APPLID(=generic-applid)
system initialization parameter. The active and alternate CICS systems
must have the same generic applid and different specific applids.
For XRF, a CICS system's generic applid is defined on the APPLID system
initialization parameter and is the name by which that CICS is known
in the network. It is the name quoted by remote CICS systems, on 
the NETNAME option of CONNECTION definitions or the APPLID option
of IPCONN definitions, to identify this CICS.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscos__CONNTYPE"><strong>Connection Type</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
type of connection between CICS regions; can be ISC, MRO, or IPCONN.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscos__RECMAXU"><strong>Maximum Receive Sessions in Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the peak number of receive sessions
in use on this connection at any one time since CICS started or since
statistics were last reset.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscos__SENMAXU"><strong>Maximum Send Sessions in Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the peak number of send sessions in
use on this connection at any one time since CICS started or since
statistics were last reset.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscos__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>


<p id="attr_cicscos__RECMAXUP"><strong>Percent of Maximum Receive Sessions in Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the percentage of the maximum number
of receive sessions that are in use based on the negotiated receive
sessions.</span></p>


<p id="attr_cicscos__SENMAXUP"><strong>Percent of Maximum Send Sessions in Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the percentage of the maximum number
of send sessions that are in use based on the negotiated send sessions.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscos__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the four-character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum four characters. z/OS System IDs are always in uppercase
characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscos__CONTOT"><strong>Total Number of Connections</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the total number of connections of
the type indicated under Connection Type.</span></p>


<p id="attr_cicscos__RECTOTU"><strong>Total Receive Sessions in Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the number of sessions of this
type that are currently used.</span></p>


<p id="attr_cicscos__SENTOTU"><strong>Total Send Sessions in Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the number of sessions of this
type that are currently used.</span></p>
