<dd class="dlentry">Warning threshold exceeded for TD buffer usage. <p>Select the Transient Data Summary workspace
to determine if transient data buffer waits are a persistent problem. If you find that a shortage of
transient data buffers is the primary cause of degradation in your system, consider changing the

your overall virtual storage requirements.</p>

<dd class="dlentry">Warning threshold exceeded for TD CI usage. <p>Consider reallocating the DFHINTRA data set with
more space to accommodate your peak transaction rate. Unlike temporary storage, each CI of the
intrapartition data set only contains records belonging to the same queue. Specifying REUSE for a
destination allows a different queue to use the CI when all records in the CI have been read. This
significantly improves performance because tasks have to incur the overhead of handling NOSPACE
conditions less often.</p>
