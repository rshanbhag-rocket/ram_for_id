for viewing or editing any other LSR Poll situations. When you click
the Situation editor icon on the toolbar to open the Situation editor
instead of through the Navigator item menu, the situation is not associated

<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_LSRPool1Str_Warning</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Warning threshold exceeded for LSR pool 1 string usage. <p>If all strings are in use, response
time is degraded. Use the LSR Pool Status workspace to analyze string and LSR pool use.
Additionally, the Bottleneck Analysis workspace can be used to determine the amount of degradation
caused by waiting for strings. If there is no evident problem, increase the number of strings in the
LSRPOOL Resource Definition.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Percent_of_Active_Strings is greater than 80 and the value of
Percent_of_Active_Strings is less than or equal to 90 and the value of Pool_ID equals 1 then
situation CICSplex_LSRPool1Str_Warning is true.</p>

LSR Pool Status workspace to analyze string and LSR pool use. Additionally, the Bottleneck Analysis
workspace and the Impact Analysis function can be used to determine if either string waits are a
problem, or if CICS® is competing with other tasks for the
same resources. If there is no evident problem, increase the number of strings in the LSRPOOL
Resource Definition.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Tasks_Waiting is greater than 1 and the value of Tasks_Waiting is

request that was satisfied from a CI currently in an LSR buffer, without incurring the overhead of a
physical I/O to a disk device. You can achieve a greater success ratio by increasing the number of
buffers defined for the LSR pool. Increasing the number of buffers, however, increases the virtual
storage requirement of your CICS region.</p>

is greater than or equal to 10 and the value of Pool_ID equals 1 then situation
