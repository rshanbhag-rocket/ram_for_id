<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicstsd__CICSTSD"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Temporary Storage Detail
attributes report on the temporary storage pools and queues that exist
in the monitored CICS system.</span> Use the CICSplex Temporary Storage
Detail attributes in situations to monitor temporary storage pools
and queues and provide data in regards to the number, size, model
name and prefix, and if the shared temporary storage queue is accessible
from the CICS region. These attributes provide data for the Temporary
Storage Queues table view.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The attributes within the CICSplex Temporary Storage Detail
group are stored for historical retrieval within the Tivoli Data Warehouse.
Selected attributes within this group are candidates for the Tivoli
Data Warehouse summarization and pruning features.</div>

<p id="attr_cicstsd__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsd__QUEUEIDX"><strong>Hex Queue ID</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the name of the temporary storage queue in hexadecimal
format.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string with a maximum of 32 characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsd__QUEUENBR"><strong>Items in Queue</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the number of items in the temporary storage queue.</span> The value
format is an integer with a maximum of two bytes, and in the range
0-32767.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsd__QUEUEINT"><strong>Last Used Interval</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the length of the interval in
binary seconds since the temporary storage queue was last referenced.</span> The
value format is a positive integer with a maximum of four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsd__QUEUEMAX"><strong>Maximum Length</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the length in bytes of the largest item in a temporary storage queue.</span> The
value format is an integer with a maximum of two bytes, and in the
range 0-32767.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsd__QUEUEMIN"><strong>Minimum Length</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the length in bytes of the smallest item in a temporary storage queue.</span> The
value format is an integer with a maximum of two bytes, and in the
range 0-32767.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsd__QUEUEMDL"><strong>Model Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string"> The
temporary storage model name used to control access to the temporary
storage queue.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string with
a maximum of eight characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsd__QUEUEPFX"><strong>Model Prefix</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string"> The
temporary storage model prefix string that best matches the temporary
storage queue ID.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string
with a maximum of 16 characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsd__QUEUEMPL"><strong>Model Pool Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string"> The
pool name that is extracted from the currently selected TS model for
the queue.</span> If the pool name is different from the pool name that
was used when it was created, then the queue is not accessible; the
n/a value is displayed when no model is found for the queue. The value
format is an alphanumeric string with a maximum of eight characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstsd__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case
sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

No Model. The n/a value is displayed for queues that are <em>not </em>shared,
for example, main and auxiliary. The Pool Mismatch value indicates
the pool that the queue was found in <em>is not </em> the same as the
queue name from the model. The No Model value indicates that <em>no </em>matching
