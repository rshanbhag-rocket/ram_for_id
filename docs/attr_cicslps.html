within the Tivoli Data Warehouse. Selected attributes within this group are candidates for the
Tivoli Data Warehouse summarization and pruning features.</div>

bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslps__LOOKAH8"><strong>Lookaside Hits 8</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The number of successful read requests that VSAM was able to satisfy
without initiating an I/O operation; that is, the requested index record was already present in one

bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslps__LOOKAR"><strong>Lookaside Ratio</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the percentage of VSAM read requests that were satisfied
without initiating I/O because the Control Interval (CI) was already resident in the buffer
pool.</span> The value format is a percentage in the range of 0-100.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslps__MAXKEY"><strong>Maximum Key Length</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The length of the largest key of a VSAM data set which might use
this LSR pool.</span> The value format is an integer of maximum two bytes. The range can be 0 -
255.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslps__OPENACB"><strong>Open ACBs</strong>

The value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name in the attribute to the names
of managed systems assigned to the item. If the origin node name matches the name of a managed
system, the status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin node and the managed
systems do not match, the status of the item remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslps__PACTIVE"><strong>Percent of Active Strings</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the percentage of strings that are currently active.</span>
The value format is a percentage in the range of 0-100.</p>

<p>This value is computed by dividing the number of active strings by the total number of
strings.</p>
