<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicscds__CICSCDS"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Dispatcher Summary attributes
report TCB activity.</span> This includes the number of TCB modes and
pools associated with each CICS region, the current and peak number
of tasks attached to the CICS region, the current exit interval, the
runaway task time, and the terminals scan delay time.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The attributes within the CICSplex Dispatcher Summary group
are stored for historical retrieval within the Tivoli Data Warehouse.
Selected attributes within this group are candidates for the Tivoli
Data Warehouse summarization and pruning features.</div>

<p id="attr_cicscds__AVGTCBSD"><strong>Average TCBs Detached</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the average number of z/OS TCBs that
have been detached by each scan of the CICS dispatcher's excess z/OS
TCB management processing.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight  characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__CSUBTASK"><strong>Concurrent Subtasks</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the current number of sub tasks.</span> It
is the current value of the CICS SUBTSKS parameter.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__ASCPUTINT"><strong>CPU Time since reset</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the accumulated CPU time since statistics
were last reset.</span> This time value is measured accurate to three
decimal places.  The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format,
for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example, 1200.567.
 If you are using variable substitution, the value in this example
would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__CATTTCBS"><strong>Current Attached TCBs</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the current number of CICS TCBs attached
in this region.</span> TCBs attached in all CICS TCB Modes contribute
to this count.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__ICVTIME"><strong>Current ICV Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the current region exit time (ICV) in milliseconds.</span> The region
exit interval is the amount of time (in milliseconds), for which CICS
releases control to the operating system if no transactions are ready
to resume processing. It is the current value of the CICS ICV parameter
as specified in the SIT. It can be changed dynamically using CEMT
SET SYSTEM TIME(value) or EXEC CICS SET SYSTEM TIME(fullword binary
data-value) commands.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__ICVRTIME"><strong>Current ICVR Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the runaway task time interval (ICVR) in milliseconds.</span> It is
the current value of the CICS ICVR parameter as specified in the SIT.
It can be changed dynamically using CEMT SET SYSTEM TIME(value) or
EXEC CICS SET SYSTEM TIME(fullword binary data-value) commands.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__ICVTSDTM"><strong>Current ICVTSD Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the terminal scan delay time (ICVTSD)
in milliseconds.</span> It is the current value of the CICSICVTSD parameter
as specified in the SIT. It can be changed dynamically using CEMT
SET SYSTEM TIME(value) or EXEC CICS SET SYSTEM TIME(fullword binary
data-value) commands.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__CNUMTSKS"><strong>Current Number of Tasks</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the current number of tasks attached
in this CICS region.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__PRTYAGE"><strong>Current PRTYAGING Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the priority aging value (PRTYAGE)
in milliseconds.</span> It is the current value of the CICS PRTYAGING
parameter.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__CUSDTCBS"><strong>Current Used TCBs</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the current number of CICS TCBs attached in this region which are
in use.</span> TCBs attached and in use in all CICS TCB Modes contribute
to this count.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__XTCBSCAN"><strong>Excess TCB Scans</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the number of Excess TCB scans performed by the dispatcher.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__MROBATCH"><strong>MRO (QR) Batching value</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the MRO batching value (MROBTCH).</span> It
is the current value of the CICS MROBATCH parameter.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__TCBMODES"><strong>Number of TCB Modes</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the number of TCB Modes defined to
this CICS region.</span></p>

this CICS region.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__PNUMTSKS"><strong>Peak Number of Tasks</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the peak number of tasks attached in
this CICS region.</span></p>

operating system within a given CICSplex.</span> The value format is
an alphanumeric string, maximum four characters, and case-sensitive.
z/OS System IDs are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscds__TCBSCAND"><strong>TCB Scans with a Detach</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the number of excess TCB scans performed
by the CICS dispatcher in which a TCB was detached.</span></p>
