<dd class="dlentry">Sympathy sickness occurs when the performance of one CICS
region is affected as a result of problems in an adjoining CICS region. <p>Use the Connections analysis workspace to examine the status of the connection
between CICS and its remote regions. Check that the remote
systems are available with connections that are in service.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Transaction_Rate is less than 10 and ((the value of
Worst_ISC_Connection_Percent_of_Links_in_Use equals 100 and the value of
Worst_ISC_Connection_Number_of_AIDs is greater than 0)or (the value of
