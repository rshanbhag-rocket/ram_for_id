<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsjpg__CICSJPG"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Java Program Analysis attributes
report data about Java program installed in your CICS systems.</span> Use
this data to determine the characteristics that have been defined
for a particular Java program.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__CEDFSTATUS"><strong>CEDF Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the action taken by the execution diagnostic facility (EDF) transaction.</span> It
returns a value indicating the action taken by the execution diagnostic
facility (EDF) transaction if this module is executed under EDF. These
are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">CEDF</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Diagnostic screens are displayed. If the program was translated
with the EDF option, all EDF screens are displayed; if it was translated
with NOEDF, only the program initiation and termination screens display.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">NOCEDF</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">No EDF screens are displayed.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">NOTAPPLIC</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">EDF is not applicable because the module is a remote program,
a map set, or a partition set.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__DATALOC"><strong>Datalocation</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
whether this module can accept data addresses higher than 16 MB.</span> These
are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">ANY</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The program can accept an address higher than 16 MB.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">BELOW</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The program requires any data address returned to it from CICS
to be less than 16 MB.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">NOTAPPLIC</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The option is not applicable because the module is a remote program,
a map set, or a partition set.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__DYNAMICST"><strong>Dynamic Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
whether the program can be dynamically routed or not.</span> It returns
a value indicating whether, if the program is the subject of a program-link
request, the request can be dynamically routed. These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">DYNAMIC</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">If the program is the subject of a program-link request, the CICS
dynamic routing program is invoked. Providing that a remote server
region is not named explicitly on the SYSID option of the LINK command,
the routing program can route the request to the region on which the
program is to execute.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">NOTDYNAMIC</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">If the program is the subject of a program-link request, the dynamic
routing program is not invoked. For a distributed program link (DPL)
request, the server region on which the program is to execute must
be specified explicitly on the REMOTESYSTEM option of the PROGRAM
definition or on the SYSID option of the LINK command; otherwise it
defaults to the local region.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__EXECKEY"><strong>Execution Key</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the execution key of the program.</span> It returns a value indicating
the storage key of the module, if it is an executable program. The
storage key can limit the areas of storage that the program can access,
depending on other variables. These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">CICSEXECKEY</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The program executes in CICS key.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">NOTAPPLIC</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The module is a remote program, a map set, or a partition set.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">USEREXECKEY</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The program executes in user key.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__EXECSET"><strong>Execution Set</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the set of CICS API commands the program can execute.</span> It returns
a value indicating whether the module is restricted to the distributed
program link subset of the CICS API. EXECUTIONSET applies only to
executable programs, and governs the API only when a program is invoked
locally. When it is invoked remotely, that is, executing at or under
the level of a program invoked by a distributed program link, a program
is always restricted to this subset. These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">DPLSUBSET</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The program is always restricted.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">FULLAPI</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The program is not restricted unless invoked remotely.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">NOTAPPLIC</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">EXECUTIONSET does not apply because the module is a remote program,
a map set, or a partition set.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__JVMCLASS"><strong>JVM Class</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the name, up to 255 characters, of any class specified in the program
definition.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__JVMPROFILE"><strong>JVM Profile</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the name of the JVM profile associated with the program.</span> It is
the eight character name of the JVM profile, as used in a program
definition. When you use the name of a JVM profile anywhere in CICS,
you must enter it using the same combination of uppercase and lowercase
characters present in the HFS file name.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
combination of the z/OS System ID (SMFID) and the CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__PROGRAM"><strong>Program</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the name of the JVM program.</span> it is an alphanumeric string with
a maximum of eight characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__REMNAME"><strong>Remote Program Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the name by which the program is known
in the remote system.</span> It is an eight character name by which
the module is known in the CICS region named in the REMOTESYSTEM option
of its PROGRAM definition. REMOTENAME applies only to programs, and
only to those defined to be remote; for local programs, the value
returned is blanks.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__REMSYSTEM"><strong>Remote System</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the name of the CICS region in which the module is defined.</span> It
is the four-character name of the CICS region in which the module
is defined (from the REMOTESYSTEM value in the PROGRAM definition).
It applies only to programs, and only to those defined to be remote;
for local programs, the value returned is blanks.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__STATUS"><strong>Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the
program status.</span> It returns a value indicating whether the module
is available for use. These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">DISABLED</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The module is not available for use.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">ENABLED</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The module is available for use.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the four character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> The format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum four characters, and case-sensitive. z/OS System IDs
are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__USECOUNT"><strong>Times Used</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the number of times the program has been executed.</span> It returns
a fullword binary field giving the total number of times the module
has been used since the start of the current CICS session. A value
of -1 is returned if the program is remote, or a JVM program.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjpg__TRANSID"><strong>Transaction ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the four character name of the transaction under which this module,
which must be a program, executes remotely (that is, the transaction
identifier that the remote region assigns to the task it creates when
a task in the local region LINKs to it).</span> This value comes from
the TRANSID option value in the PROGRAM definition and applies only
to programs defined as remote; for local programs, and when no TRANSID
is specified for a remote program, the value returned is blanks.</p>
