<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The LSR Pool Status predefined workspace  enables you to
view the general state of the Local Shared Resource (LSR) pools and
provides information related to their impact on performance. For example,
the Lookaside Ratio information indicates what percentage of records
are being retrieved from buffers rather than disks. A low Lookaside
Ratio is a negative performance indicator because the disk retrievals
are causing I/O. This workspace also provides statistical data regarding
the numbers of strings being used and the amount of string waits.</p>

<div class="section"><p>The predefined LSR Pool Status workspace contains the
following views:</p>
</div>

<div class="section"> <ul>
<li>The Local Shared Resource Pools table view provides information
about the LSR pools that have been built in CICS® for VSAM files</li>

<li>The LSR Pool Performance bar chart provides the following data
for each LSR pool: <ul>
<li> Percent of Active Strings</li>

<li> Lookaside Ratio </li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><div class="p">The  Local Shared Resource Pools table view provides the
following information: <ul>
<li>The percentage of VSAM read requests that were satisfied without
initiating I/O because the Control Interval (CI) was already resident
in the buffer pool</li>

<li>The status of the LSR pool</li>

<li>The number of current string waits</li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>You can use the CICSPlex LSR Pool Details attribute group
to customize your workspace by adding a table view to the existing
LSR Pool Status workspace that provides details on a specific LSR
pool, with regard to buffer type, and size within a CICS region. For
example, if you had users that were reporting degraded performance
and poor response times, you would check in the Local Shared Resource
Pools table view and see what CICS region LSR pool has a high number
of buffer reads and a low lookaside ratio. Then, using your newly
created details view, you see all the details for that specific LSR
pool. You notice that one file is using many more strings than the
other files. You investigate the file and find that the control interval
size index was increased causing a shortage of buffers. You resolve
the problem by adjusting the LSR pool buffer distribution accordingly.</p>
