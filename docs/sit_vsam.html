<dd class="dlentry">Warning threshold exceeded for VSAM string usage. <p>Use LSR pools so that strings and buffers
are shared for all files. LSR greatly reduces the total I/O and CPU usage in your system. If there
are no evident problems, increase the number of strings in the FCT.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of VSAM_Strings_Percent_in_Use is greater than 85 and the value of
VSAM_Strings_Percent_in_Use is less than or equal to 100 then situation CICSplex_VSAMStrUse_Warning

<dd class="dlentry">Warning threshold exceeded for VSAM string waits. <p>Consider using LSR pools so that strings
and buffers are shared by files. LSR greatly reduces the total I/O and CPU usage in your CICS® region. Use the Transaction Analysis workspace to determine
whether there is a problem that is preventing tasks from completing in a timely manner. For example,
tasks can be waiting for an enqueue or CICS can be
short-on-storage. If you determine that there is no bottleneck and the problem persists, increase
the number of VSAM strings.</p>
