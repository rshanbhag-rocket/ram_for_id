<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The single predefined situation in this category monitors
that OMEGAMON® is correctly
configured to provide the required monitoring functions.</p>

<div class="section"> <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> All attribute names in this group are prefixed with
CICSplex_Service_Task_Details.</div>

<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_WLM_Blocks_Usage_High</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">WLM blocks usage is approaching the maximum configured level. <p>Use the OMEGAMON WLM Blocks
       Usage view on the Service Task Details workspace or the F <em>agentname</em>,OC
       STATUS,WLMBLOCKS diagnostic command to determine the peak usage that the system has
       experienced for <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="deleted">either transaction or the</span>
       accumulation records. Use the <code class="ph codeph">KC5_WLM_BLOCKS</code> parameter in PARMGEN <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="ICAT">Configuration Tool</span> to adjust the WLM Blocks parameter so the peak
       value of no more that 80% is ever experienced.</p>
<p>Accumulation records are used
       to hold summaries for service classes. There is an accumulation record for each combination
       of service <span class="ph">class</span>, CICS region, <span class="ph">CICSplex,</span> and transaction ID received, as well as one extra record for each CICS
       region. The volume depends upon the number of service classes defined, transactions that are
       categorized in those service classes, and CICS regions.
        <span class="ph">When this situation fires, the number of accumulations being collected is more than the
        defined space allows, probably because the number of regions and the number of different
        types of transactions being collected have been increased.</span></p>
<p>There is a direct
       relationship between the WLM Blocks parameter and the maximum number of accumulation records.
       For example, if 500 blocks results in a consistent usage of 80%, changing the value to 1000
       blocks results in a usage of 40%.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of the attribute
       WLM_Accumulation_Data_Current_percent is greater than 70 or the value of the attribute
       WLM_Accumulation_Data_Peak_percent is greater than 80 then situation
       CICSplex_WLM_Blocks_Usage_High is true</p>
<div class="p"><strong>User response:</strong> Increase the CICS OMEGAMON agent’s WLM BLOCKS
       parameter. WLM blocks can be increased dynamically (and thereby avoid recycling the <span class="keyword">OMEGAMON AI for CICS</span> agent) by using OMEGAMON CICS
       WLM Modify commands to stop the WLM subtask and then restart it with new parameter
       values:<pre class="codeblock"><code>/F <var class="keyword varname">jobname</var>,OC STOP ID=WLM
/F <var class="keyword varname">jobname</var>,OC START ID=WLM,BLOCKS=2560</code></pre></div>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you specify only the BLOCKS parameter, WLM will be restarted using
       defaults for RESP and GOAL. If your CICS agent is running in its own address space, look at
       the KC5AGST member in the RKANCMDU library to determine what your WLM startup options
       are:<pre class="codeblock"><code>OC START ID=WLM,BLOCKS=2560,RESP=2.00,GOAL=A</code></pre>If you are using
       something other than the default startup options for RESP and GOAL, you will also need to
       include those on the START ID=WLM Modify command.</div>
