<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicscdm__CICSCDM"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Dispatcher TCB Mode attributes
report CICS dispatcher TCB mode information in an active system that
is being managed by CICSPlex SM.</span></p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The attributes within the CICSplex Dispatcher TCB Modes group
are stored for historical retrieval within the Tivoli Data Warehouse.
Selected attributes within this group are candidates for the Tivoli
Data Warehouse summarization and pruning features.</div>

<p id="attr_cicscdm__CDMTWT"><strong>Accumulated time spent in z/OS Waits</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the accumulated real time, accurate
to three decimal places that the CICS region was in a z/OS wait.</span> The
total time used between a z/OS wait issued by the dispatcher and the

format, for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example 1200.567.
 If you are using variable substitution, the value in this example
would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscdm__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each

is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

(DSTCB). The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS.DDD format, for
example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example 1200.567.  If
you are using variable substitution, the value in this example would
display as 1200567.</p>

or are in the process of being, detached from this CICS dispatcher
TCB mode.</span> This might be because, for example, the limit for the
number of TCBs allowed in the TCB pool has been lowered, or there
are too many TCBs attached in relation to the number of TCBs in use.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscdm__CDMTCBDS"><strong>Number of stolen detaches</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the number of z/OS TCBs that have been,

whether the CICS dispatcher TCB mode is Open, Not open or Unknown.</span> A
CICS dispatcher TCB mode of type Unknown indicates that this TCB mode
has not been activated.</p>

<p id="attr_cicscdm__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>
