<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsico__CICSICO"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Intercommunication Summary
attribute group provides information about the connection status of
the CICS regions.</span></p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The attributes within the CICSplex Intercommunication Summary
group are stored for historical retrieval within the Tivoli Data Warehouse.
Selected attributes within this group are candidates for the Tivoli
Data Warehouse summarization and pruning features.</div>

<p id="attr_cicsico__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__SYSIDNT"><strong>CICS SYSIDNT</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
four character CICS system ID assigned to the CICS region.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum four characters, that
is case-sensitive. CICS system IDs are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__NUMCONNS"><strong>Connection Count</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the number of connections among this region and others.</span> This
value includes MRO and ISC connections. The value format is an integer
of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__CPUUTIL"><strong>CPU Utilization</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the percentage of CPU time consumed by the CICS address space.</span> The
value is a percentage in the range of 0-999. When specifying a fractional
value, include a decimal point and either zero or one decimal place;
for example, 5.2.</p>

<p>The accumulated CPU time for the CICS address space is noted at
the beginning and end of a short elapsed-time interval. The difference
between these two values is the amount of CPU consumed in the CICS
address space during that interval; this difference is then represented
as a percentage of the elapsed-time interval. Example: If the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accumulated CPU time at the start of the time interval equals
2 seconds.</li>

<li>Length of the interval equals 10 seconds.</li>

<li>Accumulated CPU time at the end of the time interval equals 5
seconds</li>

<li>CPU consumed during the 10-second time interval equals 5-2 seconds,
which equals 3.</li>

</ul>

<p>Then percent of CPU used during the time interval equals 3/10,
or 30%.</p>

<p>A low-to-zero value indicates the absence of a workload or non
dispatch by the z/OS system. A high-to-100% (or greater) value indicates
a heavy workload or a potential loop in either the application or
CICS code. If the workload is running on multiple CPUs, the CPU utilization
can exceed 100%.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 characters, that
is case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the four-character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum four characters, and case-sensitive. z/OS System IDs
are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__TRANRATE"><strong>Transaction Rate</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the average number of transactions executed in one minute of elapsed
time.</span> The value format is an integer of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p>Example: If the statistics are collected every 10 minutes and the
number of transactions during the last 10 minutes is 300, the average
number of transactions per minute is 30.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__CICSAPPL"><strong>VTAM Applid</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the eight character, VTAM applid of the CICS region.</span> Each CICS
region has a unique VTAM applid. The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum eight characters, that is case-sensitive. The VTAM
applid is always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__CICSGAPL"><strong>VTAM Generic Applid</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the generic VTAM applid of the
CICS region.</span> Each CICS region has a unique VTAM applid. The value
format is an alphanumeric string, maximum eight characters, that is
case-sensitive. The generic VTAM applid is always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__WCISCSYS"><strong>Worst Case ISC System</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the name of the connection with
the highest percentage of ISC links in use.</span> The value format
is an alphanumeric string of maximum four characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__WCMROSYS"><strong>Worst Case MRO System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the name of the connection with
the highest percentage of MRO links in use.</span> The value format
is an alphanumeric string of maximum four characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__WCISCAID"><strong>Worst ISC Connection Number of AIDs</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the number of AIDs for the worst
case ISC system.</span> The value format is an integer of maximum two
bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__WCISCLNK"><strong>Worst ISC Connection Number of Links Defined</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the number of links defined
for the worst case ISC system.</span> The value format is an integer
of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__WCISCPCT"><strong>Worst ISC Connection Percent of Links in Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the percentage of ISC links
in use for the worst case ISC system.</span> The value format is a percentage
in the range of 0-100.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__WCMROAID"><strong>Worst MRO Connection Number of AIDs</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the number of AIDs for the worst
case MRO system ID.</span> The value format is an integer of maximum
four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__WCMROLNK"><strong>Worst MRO Connection Number of Links Defined</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the number of links defined
for the worst case MRO system ID.</span> The value format is an integer
of maximum two bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsico__WCMROPCT"><strong>Worst MRO Connection Percent of Links in Use</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the percentage of links in use
for the worst case MRO system ID.</span> The value format is a percentage
in the range of 0-100.</p>
