<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_DSAHigh_Warning</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Warning threshold exceeded for high DSA usage. <p>Consider increasing the size of the CICS® region and make the DSA larger. Increase the region size
only, if the Region Overview workspace shows adequate LSQA to support the change. It is also worth
checking the current OSCOR usage. If the DSA size cannot be increased, consider reducing the CICS MAXTASK value.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Percent_Used is greater than 70 and the value of Percent_Used is
less than or equal to 90 and the value of Area equals DSA then situation CICSplex_DSAHigh_Warning is
true.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_DSAHigh_Critical</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">This is the critical threshold exceeded for high DSA usage. <p>Consider increasing the size of
the CICS region and make the DSA larger. Increase the region
size only if the Region Overview workspace shows adequate LSQA to support the change. It is also
worth checking the current OSCOR usage. If the DSA size cannot be increased, consider reducing the
CICS MAXTASK (MXT) value.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Percent_Used is greater than 90 and the value of Area equals DSA
then situation CICSplex_DSAHigh_Critical is true.</p>

<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_EDSAHigh_Warning</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Warning threshold exceeded for high EDSA usage. <p>Increase EDSALIM in the CICS System Initialization Table. The Storage Analysis workspace provides an
overview of storage availability with in each constituent EDSA. For task and CICS component storage usage, consult the storage views.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Percent_Used is greater than 70 and the value of Percent_Used is
less than or equal to 90 and the value of Area equals EDSA then situation CICSplex_EDSAHigh_Warning

<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_PagepoolSOS_Critical</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">This is the critical threshold exceeded for Pagepool details. <p>The reported pagepool has
experienced more than one Short-On-Storage condition. Use the storage views to locate tasks using a
large amount of DSA. Verify that their storage requests are reasonable. To determine, if a given
task is hung in a storage control request, go to the <a href="rpt_trananal.html#rpt_trananal" title="The Transaction Analysis workspace shows a comprehensive view of transactions, which enables you to identify problem transactions across CICS regions and z/OS images for the CICSplex.">Transaction Analysis workspace</a>,
and look at the Wait Type column. Consider using the CICS
CEMT transaction or the <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> KILL
option to purge the offending task.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of CICSplex_Pagepool_Details.SOS_occurrences is greater than 1 then
situation CICSplex_PagepoolSOS_Critical is true.</p>
