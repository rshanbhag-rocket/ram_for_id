report on the configuration and performance data for every z/OS log
stream that is connected to CICS.</span> Use the CICSplex Log Stream
Analysis attributes in situations to quickly analyze the performance
of any connected log stream. These attributes provide data for the
Log Stream Analysis table view.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The attributes within the CICSplex Log Stream Analysis group
are stored for historical retrieval within the Tivoli Data Warehouse.
Selected attributes within this group are candidates for the Tivoli
Data Warehouse summarization and pruning features.</div>

<p id="attr_cicslsa__LOGAUTOD"><strong>Auto Delete</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
log auto delete indicator.</span> If set to Yes, the z/OS Logger automatically
deletes the data as it matures beyond the retention period, irrespective
of any log stream delete calls. If set to No, the data is only deleted
when a log stream delete call is issued and the data has matured beyond
the retention period. These are the valid values: Yes and No.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslsa__LOGAVGW"><strong>Average Bytes Written</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The average number of bytes written to
this log stream per request.</span> The value format is an integer.</p>

<p id="attr_cicslsa__LOGBRWRD"><strong>Browse Reads</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
number of browse read requests issued for this log stream.</span> If
the log stream is not part of the System Log, this field contains

type of log stream.</span> If set to Yes, the log stream is of type
DASDONLY. If set to No, the log stream is of type coupling facility
(CF). The value format is an integer.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>
