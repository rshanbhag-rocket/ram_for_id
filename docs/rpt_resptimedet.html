<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The predefined Response Time Details workspace provides
the previous nine minutes of response time data for the active group
selected from the Response Time Analysis workspace and response time
data for the selected active group that has registered activity within
the current minute.</p>

<div class="section"><p>The predefined Response Time Details workspace displays
data from the CICSplex Response Time Elements attribute group and
contains the following views:</p>
</div>

<div class="section"> <ul>
<li>Response Time Details table view </li>

<li>Current Response bar chart </li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>Transactions, programs, and terminals all present a single
row of response time information for each group element. However,
when the elements for a logical unit are displayed, three rows of
data are provided for each logical unit that show the end-to-end,
network, and host times.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>The end-to-end value represents the overall response time
of the logical unit and is the sum of the network and host times.
The bar chart delivered shows only the end-to-end value. You can easily
change this chart, using the <span class="keyword">Tivoli Enterprise Portal</span> Properties
page, to track the network and host components that comprise the end-to-end
response time. For example, a stacking bar chart might be used to
present network and host time in a way that quickly shows where a
logical unit is encountering problems.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>To view all active elements in a single display, remove
the GROUPNUM attribute from the default query shown in the <span class="keyword">Tivoli Enterprise Portal</span> Properties
page. The query can ask for elements in a single group or for all
groups. When the GROUPNUM attribute is removed, the query signals
the agent to collect and return data for every active response time
element.</p>
