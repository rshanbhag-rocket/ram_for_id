suffering from poor response time, select the record to obtain details
for the disk device. If the total number of open DCBs suggests that
contention can be a problem, or the device has a high percentage busy
value, consider moving this data set to an alternate volume on a less
busy channel.</p>

<dd class="dlentry">The data set has not been opened by the CICS region in which the
command is issued.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">VSAM</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The access method is VSAM. Access to a data table (except while
it is being loaded or, for a CICS-maintained data table, when the
source data set is being updated or searched for a record that is
not in the table), is through CICS data table services. Because this
access is still based on VSAM keys, CICS returns VSAM as the access
method for any kind of data table.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Data Table</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">This files represents a data table.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Remote</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The file is defined as remote, and therefore the access method
is not known to the local CICS system.</dd>

</dl>


<p id="attr_cicsfcd__FILEATTR"><strong>File Attributes</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Specifies whether the file is to be accessed
in RLS or non-RLS mode.</span> The file must be closed, and either disabled
or unenabled to change the access mode between RLS and non-RLS. If
the access mode is non-RLS, the value is either LSR or NSR depending
on the value specified for LSRPOOLID in the file resource definition.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcd__FILEBLKS"><strong>File Block Size</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates

the value of the DISPOSITION option for the file.</span> It is defined
in the DISPOSITION option in the FILE definition. Values are OLD and
SHARE.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcd__FILEFORM"><strong>File Format</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the type of data set that corresponds to this file.</span> The data
set must be open to return the type of data set. These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">KSDS</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The data set is a key-sequenced data set or the file refers to
a data table.</dd>

the name of the file.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcd__FILERECF"><strong>File Record Format</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the format of the records on the file.</span> These
are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">FB</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The records are of fixed length.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">U</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The format of records on the file is undefined. The Undefined
value is possible for BDAM data sets only.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">VB</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The records are of variable length. If the file is associated
with a user-maintained data table, the record format is always variable
length, even if the source data set contains fixed-length records.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsfcd__FILERKP"><strong>File Relative Key Position</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the starting position of the
key field in each record relative to the beginning of the record.</span> The
start is made at position 0. If there is no key, or if the file is
not open, CICS returns a value of zero for the key position.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcd__KEYREQ"><strong>Key Request Allowed</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
whether a file key request allowed.</span> These are the values:</p>

<dl>

<p id="attr_cicsfcd__FILEKEYL"><strong>Local File Key Length</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the length of the record key
for a file associated with a VSAM KSDS or a file associated with a
coupling facility data table.</span> If the file is associated with
a BDAM data set, the value is the length of the logical key used for
deblocking.</p>

<p>If the file is closed and the key length is not defined in the
file definition, the value returned is 0 (zero).</p>

<p>If the file is closed and a key length is defined on the file definition,
CICS returns the value from the file definition.</p>

<p>If the file is open, most files get their key length from the associated
data set, in which case CICS returns the value from the data set.
However, files that refer to coupling facility data tables defined
with LOAD(NO) must get their keylength from the file definition, in
which case CICS returns the value from the file definitions for such
files. This value must also match that of the coupling facility data
table if it has already been created.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcd__DATABUFF"><strong>Number of Data Buffers</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the number of buffers to be used for
data.</span> For RLS, BUFND is ignored and the value specified in the
ACB is returned. This parameter has no effect for hierarchical file

the value specified in the ACB macro is ignored. After OPEN a value
of 1024 is returned, indicating the maximum number of strings allowed.</p>

whether the file is open, closed, or in a transitional state.</span> These
are the values:</p>

<ul>
<li>Close</li>

<li>CloseInProgress</li>

<li>Notapplic</li>

<li>Open</li>

<li>OpenInProgress</li>

</ul>

<p>Closing a file can require dynamic deallocation
of data sets and deletion of shared resources. Close processing can
last a significant length of time.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsfcd__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>
