<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The CICS File/Database Collection Control workspace, in the enhanced 3270 user interface,
allows you to control how <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> collects
file and database details.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> can provide both task level and
file level details about certain types of data accessed by the task, including MQ. Task level will
record overall statistics for the task, where file level details report against each file or
database the task has used.</p>

<p>This feature is typically requested via the Global Data area. This panel allows you to update the
requested settings for an active CICS region. Changes made here are not permanent; they last only
until the CICS region is recycled.</p>

<div class="p">To navigate to this panel:<ol>
<li>From the <span class="keyword wintitle">All Active CICSplexes</span> panel (the <span class="keyword wintitle">CICS</span> tab on
the <span class="keyword wintitle">OMEGAMON Products</span> panel), select a CICSplex from the <span class="ph uicontrol">CICSplex
Name</span> column.</li>

<li>Find the CICS region you want to work with, on the <span class="keyword wintitle">CICSples Regions Summary</span>
panel, and enter <span class="ph uicontrol">C</span> to the left of the region name; this brings up the
<span class="keyword wintitle">CICS Control Functions</span> menu.</li>

<li>Select <span class="ph uicontrol">D CICS File/Database collection control</span> to bring up the <span class="keyword wintitle">
CICS File/Database Collection Control </span> panel. </li>

</ol>
</div>

</div>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d12749e103"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d12749e103">File/Database Collection for CICS region</h2>

<p>This top section of the panel lets you enable or disable statistics for each type of data for the
selected CICS region.</p>

<div class="sectiondiv">Task Level Monitor</div>
<p>This option will collect metrics to indicate the number of requests and how much time has elapsed
for the type of data selected. Task level monitoring cannot be changed for VSAM. </p>

<div class="sectiondiv">File Level Monitor</div>
<p>This option will collect information for each file or database the task has accessed. File level
monitoring requires that task level monitoring be active.</p>

<div class="sectiondiv">Write to Task History</div>
<p>This option will record the collected data for a task to Task History. This will provide the
information about each type of data used in the Transaction Detail panel. Selecting a type will
provide details on each file or database. </p>

<div class="sectiondiv">Write to SMF</div>
<p>This option will record the collected information to SMF. The data can then be processed by
utilities such as IBM CICS Performance Analyzer. </p>

<div class="sectiondiv">Remote Files</div>
<p>This option should only be enabled in a file owning region. Files are typically monitored from
the EXEC CICS request. In a file owning region, this may not occur, so you may want to enable this
option.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d12749e144"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d12749e144">Other Collection Statuses</h2>

<p>This panel allows you to configure several options related to Monitoring in CICS and SMF
recording.</p>

<div class="sectiondiv">CICS Monitoring Status</div>
<div class="p">This option reports on the current status of the CICS Monitoring Facility (CMF). <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> uses CMF data to provide many of the
features of <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span>. CMF is typically
enabled if it is not active when <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span>
initializes. If CMF is disabled, the following features will not be available: <ul>
<li>Task History</li>

<li>Application Trace</li>

<li>Service Level Analysis </li>

<li>File statistics </li>

<li>Storage statistics </li>

<li>Program statistics </li>

<li>Task CPU utilization </li>

<li>Resource limiting for some resource types </li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">CICS SMF Data</div>
<p>This option indicates whether <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span>
will allow CICS performance data to be written to SMF. If this is set to No, then <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> will suppress any SMF data from going to
SMF. This does not impact Task History or Service Level Analysis reporting. </p>

<div class="sectiondiv">OMEGAMON Monitoring Status</div>
<div class="p">This option reports on the current status of OMEGAMON in the CICS region. If monitoring is
disabled, <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> will not install the
exits required to collect data, and the following features will not be available:<ul>
<li>Task History </li>

<li>Application Trace</li>

<li>Service level Analysis</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">Compress OMEGAMON SMF</div>
<p>This option indicates whether OMEGAMON will compress the data that it produces before writing to
SMF. This includes the file or database records, and program statistics. If no file, database, or
program statistics are written to SMF, this option will not be applicable.</p>

<div class="sectiondiv">Include SLA Data</div>
<p>This option indicates if the SLA data for this region is to be reported upon by the OMEGAMON
<a href="rpt_srvlevel.html" title="The predefined Service Level Analysis workspace shows the overall performance of each service class defined within a workload. A high percentage of time spent for different types of waits can indicate potential problem areas. It also shows the response times for each service class.">Service Level Analysis</a> feature.</p>

<p>This panel uses attributes from the <a href="attr_cicscol.html">CICSplex Collection Control Details attribute group</a>.</p>
