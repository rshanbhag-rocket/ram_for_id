<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_delay_in_Database</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Service Level failure with excessive time spent in database. <p>Monitors for excessive
transaction response time that is attributed to database performance. There are multiple database
types (DB2®, Adabas, DLI, Datacom, and so forth) that can
potentially cause CICSplex delays. CICSplex_delay_in_Database monitors all database types. This
situation uses attributes from the CICSplex Service Class_Analysis group. This situation is
distributed automatically to the hub server; distribute it to all servers where an OMEGAMON®for CICSplex is running.</p>

<p>Use the historical transaction display function of <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> to locate the transactions that are
responsible for the service level failure. Determine whether the large amount of time spent waiting
on database activity is a consequence of either application changes or alterations in the database
configuration. If the transaction behavior is found to be normal, consider updating the service
class definitions so that they accurately reflect anticipated response times.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Performance_Index is greater than 1 and the value of
Percent_of_time_waiting_on_Adabas is greater than 90 or the value of
Percent_of_time_waiting_on_Datacom is greater than 90 or the value of Percent_of_time_waiting_on_DB2
is greater than 90 or the value of Percent_of_time_waiting_on_DLI is greater than 90 or the value of
Percent_of_time_waiting_on_IDMS is greater than 90 or the value of Percent_of_time_waiting_on_SUPRA
is greater than 90 then situation CICSplex_delay_in_Database is true.</p>

<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_delay_in_MQSeries</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Service Level failure with excessive time spent in <span class="keyword">WebSphere MQ</span>. <p>Monitors the effect of an MQ connection on a
service class. This situation evaluates the percentage of time spent waiting for an MQ connection in
relation to the performance index for a service class. It alerts the user if the performance index
for a service class exceeds 1.0 and the percentage of time spent waiting for an MQ connection
exceeds 90%. This situation uses attributes from the CICSplex Service Class_Analysis group. All
situations for Service Level Analysis attributes need to be distributed to *hub server. Do not
distribute these situations to CICS® nodes.</p>

<p>Use the historical transaction display function of <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> to locate the transactions that are
responsible for the service level failure. Determine whether the large amount of time spent waiting
on message-queuing activity is a consequence of either application changes or alterations to the
<span class="keyword">WebSphere MQ</span> system. If the transaction behavior is
found to be normal, consider updating the service class definitions so that they accurately reflect
anticipated response times.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Performance_Index is greater than 1 and the value of
Percent_of_time_waiting_on_MQ is greater than 90 then situation CICSplex_delay_in_MQSeries is
true.</p>

<dt class="dlterm">CICSplex_delay_within_CICS</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Monitors service-level failures within internal CICS
components attributed to time waiting for CICSplex resources. Initially, this situation acknowledges
when performance goals have been exceeded. It then looks for time waiting on CICSplex resources
including: <ul>
<li>CPU usage</li>

<li>Redispatch</li>

<li>Unidentifiable resources, such as program loads, interval control, Basic Mapping support, and
other ancillary items that contribute to CICSplex degradation</li>

</ul>

<p>Use the historical transaction display function of <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> to locate the transactions that are
responsible for the service level failure. The Bottleneck Analysis workspace can further assist in
locating the wait reasons responsible for slow response time. If CPU bound transactions are unable
to get the processor resources they need, consider increasing the priority of either the transaction
or the CICS region.</p>

<p>This situation uses attributes from the CICSplex Service Class_Analysis group. This situation is
distributed automatically to the hub server; distribute it to all servers where an <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> plex is running.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Performance_Index is greater than 1 and the value of
Percent_of_time_waiting_on_Redispatch is greater than 50 or the value of
Percent_of_time_waiting_on_unidentifiable is greater than 50 or the value of

File Control is a consequence of either application changes or alterations in the CICS file configuration. If the transaction behavior is found to be normal,
consider updating the service class definitions so that they accurately reflect anticipated response
times.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Service_Class_Name equals CSMI and the value of

in locating the wait reasons responsible for slow response time. If CPU limitations are found to be
the root cause, consider increasing the priority of the region to prevent File Owning Regions from
adversely affecting Application Owning Regions that use function shipping.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> If the value of Service_Class_Name equals "1,CSM" and the value of

       connected to the CICS region. Use OMEGAMON for IMS to check the condition of the connected
       IMS subsystems.</p>
