<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The CICS Task Program Detail Control workspace allows you to control how <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> collects task program details. With this
feature, <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> provides statistics about
each program that has executed in the course of a task.</p>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d74211e54"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d74211e54">Task Program Detail Status for CICS </h2>

<p>This feature is typically requested via the <span class="keyword">IBM Z OMEGAMON for CICS</span> Global Data area. The CICS Task Program
Detail Control panel allows you to update the requested settings for an active CICS region. Changes
made here are not permanent; they last only until the CICS region is recycled.</p>

<div class="p">To navigate to this panel:<ol>
<li>From the <span class="keyword wintitle">All Active CICSplexes</span> panel (the <span class="keyword wintitle">CICS</span> tab on
the <span class="keyword wintitle">OMEGAMON Products</span> panel), select a CICSplex from the <span class="ph uicontrol">CICSplex
Name</span> column.</li>

<li>Find the CICS region you want to work with, on the <span class="keyword wintitle">CICSples Regions Summary</span>
panel, and enter <span class="ph uicontrol">C</span> to the left of the region name; this brings up the
<span class="keyword wintitle">CICS Control Functions</span> menu.</li>

<li>Select <span class="ph uicontrol">T CICS Task Program Detail Control</span> to bring up the <span class="keyword wintitle">CICS
Task Program Detail Control</span> panel. </li>

</ol>
</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">Task Program Detail</div>
<p>This option collects usage information about each EXEC CICS program the task has used. This
information details the metrics for the time when the program was in control. If a program Links to
another program, that second program is assumed to be in control, and metrics are no longer
collected for the first program until control returns to it.</p>

<div class="sectiondiv">Aggregate Program Detail</div>
<p>This option will allow users to see the metrics for program usage across the entire CICS region.
These metrics are accumulated as of when the task ends. Looking at programs used within a CICS
region, the Used tab will show the collective metrics for all programs which have had data collected
since the region started or program manager statistics were reset.</p>

<div class="sectiondiv">Write to Task History</div>
<p>This option will record the collected program data for a task to Task History. This will provide
the Programs tab when looking at the details for a task. This will provide information about all
programs used during the time covered by the history record. </p>

<div class="sectiondiv">Write to SMF</div>
<p>This option will record the collected information to SMF. The data can then be processed offline
by utilities such as IBM CICS Performance Analyzer. </p>
