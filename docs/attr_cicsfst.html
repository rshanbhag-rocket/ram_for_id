group collects data about the number of application requests against
your data sets.</span> They indicate the number of requests for each
type of service that are processed against each file. If the number
of requests is totalled daily or for every CICS execution, the activity
for each file can be monitored for any changes that occur. Note that
these file statistics can have been reset during the day; to obtain
a figure of total activity against a particular file during the day.
Other data pertaining to file statistics and special processing conditions
are also collected.</p>
