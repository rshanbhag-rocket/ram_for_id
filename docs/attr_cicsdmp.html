<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsdmp__CICSDMP"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The Dump Details attributes reports the
status of both system and transaction dumps related to each CICS region.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight  characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__SHUTOPT"><strong>CICS Shutdown Option</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates whether the current CICS region
shuts down after a dump of the current type.</span> These are the values:
Yes or No.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__SCOPE"><strong>Dump Scope</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
whether the system or transaction dump requests are to be sent to
the CICS regions or performed locally.</span> This is an alphanumeric
string, with a maximum of 12 characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__MAXIMUM"><strong>Maximum number of dumps allowed</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Shows the maximum number of dumps allowed
by the current CICS regions.</span> The value format is an integer of
maximum four bytes. A value of 999 denotes that there is no limit
to the Maximum value.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__DAEOPT"><strong> MVS DAE Option</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the z/OS system dump analysis and elimination indicator.</span> This
Indicates whether these system dump requests are to be sent to the
CICS regions or performed locally. This Indicates whether these system
dump codes are eligible for suppression by the z/OS dump analysis
and elimination (DAE) component. These are the values: Yes, No or
N/A.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__SCODE"><strong>System Dump Code</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the system dump code identifier.</span> This is the identifier of the
system dump that occurred in the current CICS region. It is an alphanumeric
string, with a maximum of eight  characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__SDUMPS"><strong>System Dump Option</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
whether system dump requests for the current code are to be executed
or suppressed.</span> These are the values: Yes or No.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__SSUPR"><strong>System Dumps Suppressed</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the number of system dumps that have
been suppressed within the current recording period.</span> The count
of system dumps suppressed by the current CICS region within the current
statistics recording period. The value format is an integer of maximum
four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__STAKEN"><strong>System Dumps Taken</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the number of system dumps that have been taken within the current
recording period.</span> The count of system dumps taken by the current
CICS region within the current statistics recording period. The value
format is an integer of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__STOT"><strong>System Dump Total</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the number of system dumps taken since CICS was started.</span> The
count of system dumps taken by the current CICS region since startup.
The value format is an integer of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the four-character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum four characters, and case-sensitive. z/OS System IDs
are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__TCODE"><strong>Transaction Dump Code</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the transaction dump code identifier.</span> This
is the identifier of the transaction dump that occurred in the current
CICS region. It is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight
characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsdmp__TDUMPS"><strong>Transaction Dump Option</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates whether transaction dump requests
for the current code are to be executed or suppressed.</span> These
are the values: Yes, No, or N/A.</p>

have been suppressed within the current recording interval.</span> The
count of transaction dumps suppressed by the current CICS region within
the current statistics recording period. The value format is an integer
of maximum four bytes.</p>
