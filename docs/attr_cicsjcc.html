<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsjcc__CICSJCC"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex JVM Classcache Details attributes
report information about the size, amount of free space, date and
time when it was started, and related profile name for the given class
cache.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__AUTOSTART"><strong>Autostart</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the current status of autostart for the shared class cache.</span> These
are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">ENABLED</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The shared class cache is started as soon as CICS receives a request
to run a Java application in a JVM whose profile requires the use
of the shared class cache.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">DISABLED</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">An explicit EXEC CICS PERFORM CLASSCACHE INITIALIZE(START) command
(or the equivalent CEMT command) is required to start the shared class
cache. If the status of the shared class cache is STOPPED and autostart
is disabled, and CICS receives a request to run a Java application
in a JVM whose profile requires the use of the shared class cache,
the request fails.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__CACHEFREE"><strong>Cache Free</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the free space in the shared class cache, in kilobytes.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__CACHESIZE"><strong>Cache Size</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the size of the cache in kilobytes.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of theCICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__OLDCACHES"><strong>Number of old caches</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the number of old caches that
are still present in the region because they are waiting for worker
JVMs that are dependent on them to be phased out.</span> If the status
of the current shared class cache is STOPPED, and worker JVMs are
still dependent on it, then that shared class cache is included in
the number of old shared class caches.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the combination of the z/OS System ID (SMFID) and the CICS region
name.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32
bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__PHASINGO"><strong>Phasing Out</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the number of JVMs that are phasing out.</span> This is the number of
working JVMs that are dependent on an old shared class cache and are
being phased out. If the status of the current shared class cache
is STOPPED, then any worker JVMs that are still dependent on it are
included in the number of worker JVMs being phased out.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__PROFILE"><strong>Profile</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the name of the JVM profile used for the main JVM.</span>
The name of the JVM profile that is to be used to start the main JVM. If the main JVM is in use,
this is the name of the JVM profile for that main JVM.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__REUSEST"><strong>Reuse Status</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the reuse status of the main JVM.</span> These are the valid
values: RESET, REUSE, or UNKNOWN. The RESET value indicates that the JVMs can be reused after they
have been reset. The REUSE value indicates that the JVMs can be reused without being reset. The
UNKNOWN value indicates that the class cache has not been started.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__STARTDATE"><strong>Start Date</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the date when the current class cache was started.</span> This is an
alphanumeric string, with a maximum of 10 characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__STARTTIME"><strong>Start Time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the time when the current class cache was started.</span> This is an
alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__STARTTD"><strong>Start Time and Date</strong>
<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicateds the time and date when the current shared class cache was
started.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__STATUS"><strong>Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the current status of the shared class cache.</span> These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">STARTING</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The shared class cache is being initialized. If autostart is enabled,
the shared class cache is starting either because CICS received a
request to run a Java application in a JVM whose profile requires
the use of the shared class cache, or because an explicit <code class="ph codeph">EXEC
CICS PERFORM CLASSCACHE INITIALIZE(START)</code> command (or the
equivalent CEMT command) was issued. If autostart is disabled, the
shared class cache is starting because an explicit <code class="ph codeph">EXEC CICS
PERFORM CLASSCACHE INITIALIZE(START)</code> command (or the equivalent
CEMT command) was issued. Worker JVMs that require the use of the
shared class cache must wait until the startup process is complete
and the shared class cache is ready. If initialization of the shared
class cache is unsuccessful, any waiting requests for worker JVMs
fail.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">STARTED</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The shared class cache is ready, and it can be used by worker
JVMs.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">RELOADING</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">An <code class="ph codeph">EXEC CICS PERFORM CLASSCACHE INITIALIZE(RELOAD)</code> command
(or the equivalent CEMT command) has been issued, and a new shared
class cache is being loaded to replace the existing shared class cache.
Worker JVMs, both those that were already allocated to tasks and those
that were allocated to tasks after the command was issued, continue
to use the existing shared class cache until the new shared class
cache is ready.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">STOPPED</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The shared class cache has either not been initialized on this
CICS execution, or it has been stopped by an <code class="ph codeph">EXEC CICS PERFORM
CLASSCACHE TERMINATE</code> command or an <code class="ph codeph">EXEC CICS SET
JVMPOOL TERMINATE</code> command (or the equivalent CEMT commands).
If autostart is disabled, requests to run a Java application in a
JVM whose profile requires the use of the shared class cache (that
is, requests for worker JVMs) fails. If autostart is enabled, a new
shared class cache is initialized as soon as CICS receives a request
to run a Java application in a JVM whose profile requires the use
of the shared class cache.</dd>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the four character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum four characters, and case-sensitive. z/OS System IDs
are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsjcc__TOTALJVMS"><strong>Total JVMs</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the number of working JVMs in the CICS region that are dependent on
the shared class cache.</span></p>
