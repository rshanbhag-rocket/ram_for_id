<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Transaction Details workspace is accessed from the
Transaction Analysis workspace. The EXEC interface block (EIB) summary
table accesses all the fields in the EIB by name. The EIB contains
information that is useful during the execution of an application
program, such as the transaction identifier, the time and date (initially
when the task is started, and subsequently, if updated by the application
program using ASKTIME), and the cursor position on a display device.
The EIB also contains information that is helpful when a dump is used
to debug a program.</p>

<div class="section"><p>The predefined Transaction Details workspace contains
the following table views:</p>
</div>

<div class="section"> <ul>
<li>The Details for Transaction <strong>tranid</strong>. This provides details
of the transaction ID that you selected from the transaction analysis
panel. These are the details: <ul>
<li>task number resource name and type</li>

<li>time in suspend</li>

<li>CPU used by this task.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>The EIB Summary view displays the details of the EXEC interface
block (EIB). The following information is provided for each transaction
number and task ID:  <ul>
<li> The EXEC CICS® command,
the function code, the EIBRESP description and value, EIBRESP2 value,
resource name, EIB date and time. </li>

<li> The program name, program offset, and terminal ID. </li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>The Association Data view displays details related to individual
transactions. The data enables you to determine the starting point
for a transaction in an IPIC (IP Interconnectivity) network, and also
includes any user data that has been added.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>From the Transaction Details table, you can link the <a href="rpt_cicstrf.html#rpt_cicstrf" title="The predefined Transaction EIB Details workspace displays detailed information about each EIB and application program details.">Transaction EIB Details workspace</a> to further investigate
the details related to a transaction. The EIB details workspace also
shows the Application Program table.</p>
