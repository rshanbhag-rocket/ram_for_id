<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsuwe__CICSUWE"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex UOW Enqueue Analysis attribute
group provides a summary of the current units of work in a CICS region.</span></p>

<p id="attr_cicsuwe__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsuwe__UOWEFAIL"><strong>Enqueue Failures</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the total number of enqueue failures that have occurred against this
UOW.</span> The value format is an integer of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsuwe__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is
the combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 characters, that
is case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsuwe__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the four character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum four characters, and case-sensitive. z/OS System IDs
are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsuwe__UOWSTIM"><strong>Time Shunted</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the total time, (accurate to three decimal places) that each UOW has
been shunted, pending resolution.</span> The value can be entered in
the hh:mm:ss.ddd format, for example, 00:20:00.567 or as sssssss.ddd,
for example 1200.567.  If you are using variable substitution, the
value in this example would display as 1200567. The value format is
an integer of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsuwe__UOWTRAN"><strong>Transaction ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the Transaction ID that started this unit-of-work.</span> The value
format is an alphanumeric string of maximum four characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsuwe__UOWID"><strong>UOW ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the unit-of-work identifier.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string of maximum 16 characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsuwe__UOWSTATE"><strong>UOW State</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the state of the unit-of-work.</span> These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Forward</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Indicates a decision to commit the UOW has been made, but the
UOW is waiting or has been shunted. Look at the wait state of the
UOW</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Backward</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Indicates that the UOW is being backed out, or has failed to back
out one or more recoverable resources involved in the UOW</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Indoubt</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Indicates UOW is in the indoubt phase of 2-phase commit processing</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Inflight</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Indicates UOW is running normally</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Heur_Fwd</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Indicates the UOW has been forcibly committed</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Heur_Bwd</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Indicates the UOW has been forcibly backed out</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Unknown</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Indicates the UOW state is unrecognized</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsuwe__UOWWAIT"><strong>Wait State</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the wait state of the unit-of-work.</span> These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Active</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Indicates the UOW is running normally.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Shunted</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Indicates syncpoint processing for the UOW has been deferred and
the UOW has been shunted. The task and related storage have been freed
but the locks associated with the UOW have been retained.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Unknown</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Indicates the UOW wait state is unrecognized.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Waiting</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Indicates that syncpoint processing has completed on this local
CICS system, but not on all systems involved in the distributed UOW.</dd>
