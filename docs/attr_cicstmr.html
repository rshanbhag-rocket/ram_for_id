<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicstmr__CICSTMR"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Transaction Manager Statistics
attribute group returns information about the transaction activity
in your CICS system (such as the total number of transactions attached).</span> You
can also specify a single transaction that you are interested in (for
example, CEMT).</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The attributes within the CICSplex Transaction Manager Statistics
group are stored for historical retrieval within the Tivoli Data Warehouse.
Selected attributes within this group are candidates for the Tivoli
Data Warehouse summarization and pruning features.</div>

<p id="attr_cicstmr__CAT"><strong>Active User Transactions</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the current number of active user transactions.</span> The
value format is an integer of maximum four bytes.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstmr__AVQCUR"><strong>Average Current queuing time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the average time (accurate to three
decimal places) spent waiting by those currently queued transactions
and the time that they have been waiting for MAXTASK reasons.</span> The
value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS:DDD format, for example, 00:20:00.567
or as SSSSSSS.DD , for example, 1200.567.  If you are using variable
substitution, the value in this example would display as 1200567.</p>

<p id="attr_cicstmr__AVMXTQ"><strong>Average MAXTASK queuing time</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Is the average time (accurate to three
decimal places) spent waiting by those user transactions that had
to wait for MAXTASK reasons.</span> It is the total time spent at MAXTASK
divided by the total number of transactions that have been delayed
because of MAXTASK. The value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS:DDD format,
for example, 00:20:00.567 or as SSSSSSS.DDD, for example, 1200.567.

the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each

is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

the current MAXTASK (MXT) value.</span> The specified maximum number

value can be entered in the HH:MM:SS:DDD format, for example, 00:20:00.567
or as SSSSSSS.DDD , for example 1200.567.  If you are using variable
substitution, the value in this example would display as 1200567. <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This

combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>
