<div class="body">
<p><span class="ph synph" id="attr_cicsexd__CICSEXD"></span> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Exit Program Analysis attribute
groups returns information about a global user exit or a task-related
user exit.</span> This information is retrieved using the EXEC CICS
INQUIRE EXITPROGRAM command.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsexd__APITYPE"><strong>API Type</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
which APIs the task related user exit program uses.</span> These are
the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">BASE_API</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">CICSAPI has replaced BASEAPI. Both these values have the same
meaning, and, for compatibility, BASEAPI is still accepted by the
translator.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">CICS_API</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The task related user exit program is enabled as either QUASIRENT
or THREADSAFE, but without the OPENAPI option. This means it is restricted
to the CICS permitted programming interfaces. In releases before CICS
Transaction Server for z/OS version 3, this CVDA was called BASEAPI.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">OPEN_API</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The task related user exit program is enabled with the OPENAPI
option. This means it is permitted to use non CICS API, for which
purpose CICS gives control to the task related user exit under an
L8 mode open TCB. OPENAPI assumes that the program is written to threadsafe
standards.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsexd__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates
the job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight characters, and
case sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsexd__CONCURSTAT"><strong>Concurrency Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the concurrency status of the
task-related user exit program, as specified by the latest ENABLE
command for this program.</span> These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">QUASIRENT</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The task related user exit program is defined as being quasi reentrant,
and is able to run only under the CICS QR TCB when invoking CICS services
through the CICS API. To use any MVS, this task-related user exit
program must switch to a privately managed TCB.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">THREADSAFE</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The program is defined as threadsafe, and is capable of running
under an open TCB. If the APIST option returns OPENAPI, it is invoked
under an open TCB. If the APIST option returns BASEAPI, it is invoked
under whichever TCB is in use by its user task when the program is
given control, which could be either an L8 mode open TCB or the CICS
QR TCB.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsexd__CONNECSTAT"><strong>Connection Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates the state of the connection
between the exit and the external resource manager that it supports.</span> CONNECTST
enables you to determine whether the specified exit has connected
to its resource manager, so that CICS tasks can safely issue API requests
to the resource manager. These are the values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Connected</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The task related user exit is connected to its external resource
manager subsystem, and API requests can be issued.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">n/a</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The exit is not a task related user exit.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Not Connected</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The task related user exit is not connected to its external resource
manager subsystem, and therefore API requests cannot be issued.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Unknown</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The task- related user exit has been enabled and started, but
not enabled for SPI requests. UNKNOWN can also be returned if CICS
is unable to call the task related user exit. In both of these cases,
CICS cannot tell whether it is connected to its external resource
manager.</dd>

</dl>

<p id="attr_cicsexd__EDFFORMAT"><strong>EDF Format Status</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">Indicates that the FORMATEDF option is
enabled for the exit.</span> FORMATEDF causes extra invocations of the
exit for tasks executed under EDF, to format output screens and interpret
input, and applies only to task related user exits. These are the
values:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">On</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">FORMATEDF processing is turned on.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Off</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">FORMATEDF processing is turned off.</dd>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
