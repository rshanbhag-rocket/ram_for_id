<span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The CICSplex Event Processing Details attribute group displays
information about CICS event processing.</span> CICS event processing can emit events at a number of
clearly defined points, known as capture points. You can think of a capture point as an opportunity
for an event to be emitted.</p>

<p>You can use event processing in many ways, such as to detect customer
trends or to detect abnormalities in patterns of customer behavior
to identify potential irregular or fraudulent situations.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsevd__CAPTURE"><strong>Captured events</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
total number of captured events during event processing.</span> This
total amount is an integer with a maximum of eight characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsevd__CNAME"><strong>Capture Point Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
name of the capture point event specification.</span> This name is an
alphanumeric string, with a maximum of 32 characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsevd__CTYPE"><strong>Capture Point Type</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
type of capture point event specification used during event processing.</span> These
are the valid type values:</p>

<ul>
<li>PRECOMMAND 1</li>

<li>POSTCOMMAND 2</li>

<li>PROGRAMINIT 3</li>

</ul>

<p id="attr_cicsevd__NAME"><strong>Capture Specification</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
name of the capture specification used during event processing.</span> The
capture specification is the capture point, capture data, and predicates
for filtering. The capture specification includes information describing
how to obtain the emitted business information from the data available
for capture. This name is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of
32 characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsevd__CICSNAME"><strong>CICS Region Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
job name or modify ID of the CICS region being monitored.</span> Each
CICS region in a z/OS operating system  has a unique name. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of eight  characters, and
case-sensitive. CICS region names are always in uppercase characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsevd__BINDING"><strong>Event Binding</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
name of the XML definition that defines one or more business events
to the CICS application.</span> Event binding consists of event specifications,
capture specifications, and adapter dispatcher information. This name
is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of 32 characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsevd__ENAME"><strong>Event Name</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
event processing name associated with the capture point specification.</span> This
name is an alphanumeric string, with a maximum of 32 characters.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsevd__ORIGINNODE"><strong>Origin Node</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
combination of z/OS System ID (SMFID) and CICS region name.</span> The
value format is an alphanumeric string, maximum 32 bytes, and case-sensitive.</p>

<p>When a situation is true, the system compares the origin node name
in the attribute to the names of managed systems assigned to the item.
If the origin node name matches the name of a managed system, the
status of the item changes accordingly. If the names of the origin
node and the managed systems do not match, the status of the item
remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="attr_cicsevd__SYSTEMID"><strong>System ID</strong> <span class="ph" data-hd-otherprops="flyover_string">The
four-character name that uniquely identifies an active z/OS operating
system within a given CICSplex.</span> The value format is an alphanumeric
string, maximum four characters, and case-sensitive. z/OS System IDs
are always in uppercase characters.</p>
